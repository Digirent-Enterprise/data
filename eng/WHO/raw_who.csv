a5b3de9f-f461-4d82-a57b-1ef8f5ae03aa,Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 or develop more severe COVID-19?,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) who have not achieved viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment (ART) may have a compromised immune system that leaves them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and further HIV disease progression. There is no clinical evidence that PLHIV have a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when compared with HIV-negative people. There are several small studies conducted early in the pandemic that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in PLHIV, indicating that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar in people with and without HIV, particularly if they are on ART and have achieved HIV viral suppression However, global data compiled by WHO from almost 350 000 patients in 38 countries indicate that PLHIV are at increased risk for development of severe illness and death due to COVID-19. This analysis found that the risk of developing severe fatal COVID-19 was 38% greater in this population when compared to people without HIV infection (1). PLHIV frequently face adverse social determinants of health and structural factors that may lead to higher SARS-CoV-2 exposure. They also have a high prevalence of some comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension. Additionally, lower CD4 T-cell counts are associated with advanced HIV disease and several epidemiological studies are suggesting that this HIV subpopulation are at greater risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and mortality. Taken all these considerations together, there is no clear evidence of a higher risk for PLHIV to be infected with SARS-COV-2 when compared with the general population. However, those with advanced HIV disease, those with low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral load and those who are not taking ART have an increased risk of COVID-19 complications in general.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
2c8dc2ad-e94d-49ba-ba06-9561bb7eb21d,Should the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 be different in people living with HIV?,"Current recommendations for COVID-19 clinical management in people living with HIV generally do not differ from those of the general population, including treatment and prevention measures. PLHIV are as eligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies as people without HIV infection and those individuals with advanced HIV disease should be considered as a high priority.When starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV, clinicians should pay careful attention to potential interactions between drugs and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments, antiretrovirals (ARV), antimicrobial therapies, and other medications. PLHIV who develop COVID-19 should continue their ARV regimen, opportunistic infection treatment and prophylaxis whenever possible. The ARV regimen should not be switched or adjusted (i.e., by adding ARV drugs to the regimen) for the purpose of preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.Individuals who know their HIV status are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as the general population (e.g., wash hands often, practice cough hygiene, avoid touching your face, social distancing, seek medical care if symptomatic, self-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions recommended in the government’s response). PLHIV who are taking ARV drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days of ARVs, if not a 3- to 6-month supply.It is also an important opportunity to ensure that all PLHIV who are not yet on antiretroviral treatment begin to do so.  People who feel they may have been at HIV risk are advised to seek testing to protect against HIV disease progression and complications from any other health issues.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
a2793ad3-96dc-4567-b477-6c617e4c814e,Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19 or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection?,"No ARVs are currently recommended by WHO to treat or prevent COVID-19. Initial in vitro, animal and small human observational studies conducted during previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) and in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested that some ARVs, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), could help against SARS-CoV-2 and should be repurposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This hypothesis was subsequently assessed in further observational studies and in large randomized controlled trials, but no clinical benefit or impact on disease severity or mortality were demonstrated (2).   Several observational studies also indicated that use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) could be associated with lower risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19. However, these studies had limitations and may have been influenced by other health issues in the participants.. Subsequent larger observational studies and clinical trials have not found a relationship between TDF or TAF and risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or severe outcomes.   While the evidence of benefit of using ARVs to treat coronavirus infections was not demonstrated, serious side effects from these drugs were not rare. The routine use of LPV/r and TDF or TAF as part of treatment regimens for HIV can be associated with several side effects of moderate severity. Therefore, at this time there is no evidence to suggest that any particular ARV agent improves or worsens COVID-19 clinical outcomes in PLHIV, or can be used for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. WHO recommends maintaining the standard approaches to initiation and continuation of ART in PLHIV, with a focus on reducing HIV-associated immune compromise and achievement of virologic suppression. The same principles are applicable for use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens for HIV prevention.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
5a27901c-d30c-4745-b0bc-adb749b5f759,Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for people living with HIV?,"Many of the initial clinical studies with COVID-19 vaccines have included a small number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in their trials. Despite limited data, available information from those studies suggests that current WHO recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe for PLHIV. The currently available COVID-19 vaccine products are not live vaccines but
include modified viral proteins or genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 which cannot replicate or cause changes to human genes. More recent observational studies have further evaluated the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in this population and didn’t
find any evidence of a higher rate of unusual side effects after vaccination when compared with general population. In addition, no pharmacological interactions have been reported between COVID-19 vaccines and antiretroviral medications (ARV) which
PLHIV should continue to take after vaccination to maintain health.Recently, a debate in the scientific community has led to broader concerns about a potential association observed more than a decade ago between adenovirus vector-based vaccines and an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection among men who received this
type of vaccine. This unexpected finding was detected in two HIV vaccine trials that used adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector containing products (3, 4). The reason for this observed increase in the HIV acquisition risk remains uncertain, although
several hypothetical mechanisms have suggested a possible interference in the HIV specific vaccine response or in the CD4 T-cell susceptibility to HIV infection induced by pre-existing adenovirus- associated immunity in combination with other factors. 
However, a third study also using Ad5 vector-based HIV vaccine has not reported this finding (5).Despite
these potential concerns, it is important to highlight that the benefits of all authorized COVID-19 vaccines in a pandemic context largely outweigh this potential risk. The theoretical concern on increased risk of HIV acquisition is confined to a specific
Ad5 vectored HIV vaccine and should not be extended to other vaccine platforms. However, as several COVID-19 vaccines are using human and animal adenovirus vector platforms, specific studies are encouraged to better assess the safety of Ad5 vectored COVID-19
vaccines in sub-populations at high risk of HIV acquisition. An extended follow-up from a Phase III study of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is currently evaluating HIV seroconversion rates in the participants, and interim results are expected in the
end of 2022. Global data have shown that PLHIV have a 38% greater risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19 compared to people without HIV infection. For this reason, it is important to prioritize PLHIV to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. People with stable HIV disease
have been now included in several COVID-19 vaccine trials, and specific cohort studies on COVID-19 vaccines with PLHIV has been recently rolled out. Therefore, more information on this topic specific to PLHIV is expected in the future. WHO will continue
to monitor the situation as new data become available and SAGE recommendations will
be updated accordingly.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
6be99f19-625b-4eee-aed8-c709bf846e55,Can COVID-19 infection affect HIV test results?,"Recent research suggests that some people have had false reactive HIV test results when they had COVID-19 (3, 4). These studies evaluated individuals using a 4th generation serology HIV assays. Over the past 4 decades, cross-reactivity due to viral or bacterial infections has been reported with serology HIV assays.

9ae403fc-32d5-4068-9e6f-6b9943497490,Do COVID-19 vaccines provide protection for people living with HIV?,"Current available studies on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in PLHIV with high CD4 T-cell counts and using ART, indicate that most of these individuals produce antibody levels and cellular immune response in the same range observed in people without
HIV infection, suggesting that current recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe and protective in this population. However, there is data in these studies from individuals with low CD4 T-cell counts (i.e., below 200 cells/mm3) or without HIV viral suppression that show a reduced immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, the antibody responses after vaccination may dwindle faster than people with higher CD4 T-cell counts. This reduced immune response to COVID-19 vaccines has also been reported in individuals with other causes of severe immunodeficiency (e.g., solid and hematologic malignancies, people with organ transplants and in hemodialysis). Suboptimal immune response against certain vaccine preventable diseases has also been demonstrated in people with advanced HIV disease and/or lower CD4 T-cell counts. Higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary vaccination (i.e., breakthrough infections) among PLHIV when compared with people without HIV have been described. A population-level analysis conducted in immunocompromised patients indicated a 33% higher incidence rate of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections among PLHIV, albeit without accounting for HIV-specific factors (10). Additionally, a large HIV cohort study with more than 100 000 individuals vaccinated and with good HIV control showed a low overall (3.8%) but 28% higher risk of breakthrough infection without association with HIV viral load or CD4 T-cell counts. The breakthrough rate was also higher in people with vs without HIV (55 cases per 1000 person-years vs 43 cases per 1000 person-years) (11).These higher rates and risk of breakthrough infections observed in PLHIV when compared with the general population should not be a reason to postpone or to avoid COVID-19 vaccines in these patients, who have a higher risk of COVID-19 complications and death. It supports the recommendation for the use of additional primary doses in this population as in other immunocompromised groups. Furthermore, national COVID-19 immunization programmes should not exclude people from key and vulnerable populations at risk of HIV, who frequently have limited access to health services. WHO will continue to monitor emerging evidence and will provide timely guidance updates.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
18d134b2-ddf5-4535-818e-3567c52a39a4,Should people living with HIV get vaccines early in the roll out?,"WHO currently recommends that PLHIV should be included as a priority population for COVID-19 immunization. It has been supported by growing evidence suggesting that PLHIV, particularly those with advanced HIV disease, lower CD4 T-cell count, or non-suppressed viral load appear to be at increased risk of poor outcomes and death due to COVID-19 when compared with people without HIV infection (12). Furthermore, many PLHIV have 1 or more chronic comorbidities that may put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death, independent from their HIV disease or immune status. Therefore, PLHIV, particularly those with co-morbidities (such chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, motor neurone or Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, severe obesity) should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination.Many countries have included PLHIV as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination according to their epidemiological context, prioritizing vaccination for all PLHIV or those who are immunocompromised (as indicated by having a CD4 T-cell count <200/mm3) (13). In mid-2021, according an informal WHO poll survey conducted with more than 100 countries from all regions, more than 40 have established a COVID-19 immunization policy that prioritizes vaccinations for PLHIV. However, the real coverage of COVID-19 vaccination among PLHIV in countries varies widely. A regional survey conducted at the end of 2021 in central and eastern Europe found that PLHIV had been prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination in 8 of the 22 countries and only 3 countries had formulated guidelines for the vaccination of PLHIV (14). A recent study conducted in New York State, USA, found that COVID-19 vaccination coverage among PLHIV was lower than that in the general adult population (63.5% vs 75.0%) (15).Differences in demographic composition between PLHIV and the general population might partly explain lower coverage; however, coverage was 75% lower across all examined PLHIV subgroups. Unmeasured structural factors, including socioeconomic status, might further explain the lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage among this group. As countries are in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout and have different demographic structure, they should also refer to the  WHO SAGE Roadmap for Prioritizing Uses of COVID-19 Vaccines  for operational details.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
9bacf549-4797-4367-9ac6-a55926f19179,Should all people living with HIV receive additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine?,"Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in most PLHIV, with significant reduction in the risk of severe COVID-19 disease or death when the standard regimen (currently 1 or 2 doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) is fully taken as recommended. However, there is a growing evidence of a suboptimal immune response to the standard course of COVID-19 vaccination in people with moderate to severe immunodeficiency, including those with advanced HIV disease, lower CD4 T-cell counts, or unsuppressed viral load.Therefore, in people with moderate to severe advanced HIV disease, an additional vaccine dose should be administered as part of the extended primary series and should be given 1–3 months after the completion of the primary series to enhance the immune response and increase protection. This approach is recommended by WHO as well as several other major COVID-19 guidelines.A gradual reduction of vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been observed after the completion of primary COVID-19 vaccine series, even in those individuals without clinical immunodeficiency and with good initial response to the primary vaccine course. Many countries are now recommending the administration of an additional vaccine dose as a booster in all individuals, including PLHIV who are asymptomatic or mild clinical immunodeficiency and CD4 counts above 200 T-cells/mm3 and virologically suppressed. This booster dose can be taken 4 to 6 months after the completion of the primary vaccination series. The objective of the booster doses strategy is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient. Some countries are implementing a second booster dose for their highest risk populations, including people with moderate to severe advanced HIV disease, 3–5 months after an initial booster dose. More data on the waning of protective immunity and vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and hospitalization after an initial booster dose is required before WHO endorsed recommendation on the additional booster dose. According to the WHO SAGE roadmap, the highest priority continues to be ensuring that all PLHIV receive their primary vaccine series against COVID-19, complemented by an additional dose in those with advanced HIV disease.Risk of development of immune escape variants in immunosuppressed patientsPeople with moderate to severe immunodeficiency have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 and suffering from a long-term persistent infection with prolonged viral shedding due to suboptimal immune response. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., facial mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (e.g., additional vaccine doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.This situation can create an environment for immune escape and selection of evolutionary variants. Several case reports indicated that multi-mutational SARS-CoV-2 variants can arise during such persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals and could result in novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The findings that immunocompromised patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection may generate new SARS-CoV-2 variants have several medical and public health implications. Heightened precautions should be taken to avert nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among immunocompromised patients. Such patients should be prioritized for anti-COVID-19 immunization not only to protect them but also to mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv
c511e80a-ec39-40bc-afca-47b90f5112ab,What is WHO’s position on clinical trials/research while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing?,"WHO is providing support and direction to the scientific community and welcomes the research and development of effective tests, vaccines, medicines and other interventions for COVID-19.For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development, including for clinical trials of new drugs and vaccines. The WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, will serve as the global
strategy for research and development activities. Its aim is to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large scale crises. As part of this, WHO is leading the global prioritization
of candidate vaccines and therapeutics for development and evaluation. To support testing, WHO convened a scientific advisory group to develop guidance on trial designs for experimental vaccines and therapeutics.WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials for existing antivirals and other medicines that are being conducted for COVID-19.

753eb185-51ec-4ad5-bf00-dd938a996a3b,What can WHO and the world do to support people living with HIV to live a healthy life?,"While WHO is working with countries to ensure fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to continue actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Alongside the response to COVID-19, it is critical to maintain access to essential health services. This includes:supporting PLHIV to continue taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adapting services to make this easier and more efficient during the COVID-19 response;continuing to provide HIV prevention and testing services with linkage to ART initiation as a priority;ensuring those who start ART can remain on it to reduce health risks and complications during COVID-19. This must be classified as an essential service, together with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of co-morbidities and co-infections; andmonitoring all PLHIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those with advanced HIV disease or with co-morbidities.Although there may be an increase in the risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19 among PLHIV, making sure that people have access to effective ART and other health care services they need will help minimize this risk.

e8ff21eb-0a8d-475c-97ab-341287952dc9,MYTH: Tobacco growing is good for the economy as the government is earning foreign exchange,"FACT: In most countries, tobacco growing contributes to less than 1% of the GDP.The economic contribution of tobacco growing to local and national economies, employment figures and the national balance of trade is usually highlighted by the tobacco industry to prevent governments from adopting strong national tobacco control policies to protect the health of their people. In reality, there is no direct link between tobacco farming and demand for tobacco leaves in the country. In fact, the global nature of tobacco production and international trade makes it possible to import tobacco leaves from any country in the world. The economic value of tobacco as a profitable business and assured export market is also a common argument against switching to alternative crops. A large number of tobacco growing economies are facing food insecurity and are dependent on other countries for food. They are using the foreign exchange earned from exporting tobacco leaf to buy food when they have the land to grow food themselves.Many governments provide credits and loans, or significant subsidies to support tobacco growing so they are paying already highly profitable foreign transnational companies.  Farmers in many countries get government subsidies for tobacco, which is counter to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) (e.g. North Macedonia, Lebanon, etc.). Yet, research consistently demonstrates that many farmers overestimate what they make from tobacco and how much it costs to produce it.

Nonetheless, the tobacco industry targets smallholder farmers to grow a crop that cannot be consumed as food and earns little money for household.Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries are often contracted to grow tobacco through legal agreements with large transnational companies or their intermediaries under which tobacco prices and grades (or quality) are determined by the buyer, leaving farmers little room for negotiation. The buyer most often undergrade and therefore underprice the tobacco leaf, and at the same time inflate the cost of the inputs, further disadvantaging the farmers. The prices for tobacco leaf have also decreased since 2013, leaving the farmers with a labour-intensive production with very low profits for the time spent in growing the crop.Evidence shows that the labour costs of tobacco growing are enormous, as much as double the labour needed to produce other similar crops. The number of hours needed for tobacco growing does not translate to high profits for the farmers. The labour intensiveness of tobacco farming also means they don’t have time to gain education certificates or develop skills to be able to work in other areas where they could earn the family more money.Additionally, the cost of seeds, fertilizers, wood for fuel and renting or buying land is high and often not factored in when assessing the profitability of tobacco growing. Oftentimes the tobacco industry advances the cost of these, which is then deducted from farmers’ payment at the end of the season. Through this contractual arrangement, farmers end up disadvantaged, dependent and then trapped in a vicious circle of debt, unable to get a fair price for their product. Tobacco companies are able to do this because in most countries there is lack of rural credit programmes for other crops.It is also important to note that tobacco growing burdens farmers with health issues that can be unique to this activity, such as green tobacco sickness, also increases overall household health-care costs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-growing--myth-buster

At the same time, they end up trapped in a vicious cycle where they become dependent on the tobacco industry or its front groups.It is important for governments to provide the support needed to tobacco growing farmers to shift to viable alternative value chains. In many tobacco growing countries, credit is scarce and tobacco farming continues to be perceived by governments and farmers as a source of income/cash to generate revenues that would pay, for example, to support education and health needs of farmers.There are a growing number of schemes providing alternative options for credit and banking for farmers and these need to reviewed to not allow easy credits to tobacco growing and ensure they are diverted to alternative crops.

To make space for tobacco crops, trees must be cut down and land cleared. It takes roughly one tree to make 300 cigarettes. This leads to desertification and hunger as there is limited fertile land to grow food in some of these regions. Approximately 200 000 hectares (ha) of land are cleared for tobacco agriculture and curing each year, which is equivalent to the size of Mauritius (204 000 ha).The environmental risks of tobacco leaf production are frequently underreported by the tobacco industry.

The industry has set up several organizations and programmes which aim to support the livelihoods of tobacco-growing communities through crop diversification methods and schemes that aim to improve living standards of farmers. Introducing new crops while continuing to grow tobacco does not eliminate the risks of tobacco growing. These efforts divert public attention away from the real costs of tobacco farming, such as poor health outcomes, environmental degradation and poverty.Other greenwashing initiatives like tree planting divert attention from the industry’s environmentally damaging practices and helps them avoid being held accountable, and planting a few trees for a quick harvest will not replace the natural quality of the millennia old forests that are cut down every year for curing tobacco leaf.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-growing--myth-buster
0f2fb675-631b-4b62-82fa-551e32f78b62,MYTH: WHO and the WHO FCTC are anti-tobacco farmers,"FACT:  Tobacco use is the single most preventable form of premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, respiratory disorders, heart diseases, etc. NCDs form the highest share of healthcare costs which burden on most economies including in LMICs and LDCs. The WHO FCTC provides an overarching and enabling set of actions to reduce the use of tobacco, by adoption of evidence-based solutions. More than 180 countries have adopted the WHO FCTC for achieving their goal of health for all.WHO supports global efforts to achieve better health for all including, accelerated implementation of WHO FCTC in line with SDG commitments, specifically Target 3,a.That means supporting farmers to grow crops that are healthy and sustainable for them and their communities.  Evidence shows that tobacco farmers’ income and wellbeing could improve if they diversified away from tobacco to food crops. Governments, international organizations, NGOs and private companies need to work together to help farmers diversify away from tobacco to healthy food crops by ensuring that they have easy access to more profitable markets.Article 17 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) states that Parties “shall, in cooperation with each other and with competent international and regional intergovernmental organizations, promote, as appropriate, economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers, growers and, as the case may be, individual sellers”.

Young people are more likely to delay the onset of sexual activity – and when they do have sex, to practice safer sex – when they are better informed about their sexuality, sexual health and their rights.

Intended to support school-based curricula, the UN’s global guidance indicates starting CSE at the age of 5 when formal education typically begins. However, sexuality education is a lifelong process, sometimes beginning earlier, at home, with trusted caregivers. Learning is incremental; what is taught at the earliest ages is very different from what is taught during puberty and adolescence. With younger learners, teaching about sexuality does not necessarily mean teaching about sex. For instance, for younger age groups, CSE may help children learn about their bodies and to recognize their feelings and emotions, while discussing family life and different types of relationships, decision-making, the basic principles of consent and what to do if violence, bullying or abuse occur. This type of learning establishes the foundation for healthy relationships throughout life.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/comprehensive-sexuality-education

It calls for children aged 12–15 years to be made aware that sexual abuse, sexual assault, intimate partner violence and bullying are a violation of human rights and are never the victim’s fault. Finally, it calls for older adolescents – those aged 15–18 – to be taught that consent is critical for a positive sexual relationship with a partner.

It is a viral infection which can spread between people and occasionally from the environment to people via things and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. In settings where the monkeypox virus is present among some wild animals, it can also be transmitted from infected animals to people who have contact with them. Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO has begun using a new preferred term “mpox” as a synonym for monkeypox.

210e6602-6917-4aef-9af6-8e2730bd1184,What are the symptoms of mpox?,"Mpox can cause a range of signs and symptoms. While some people have less severe symptoms, others may develop more serious illness and need care in a health facility. Those typically at higher risk of more severe symptoms include people who are pregnant, children and persons that are immunocompromised, including people with untreated and advanced HIV disease.Common symptoms of mpox include a rash which may last for 2–4 weeks. This may start with, or be followed by, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands (lymph nodes). The rash looks like blisters or sores, and can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions. These lesions may also be found in the mouth, throat, anus, rectum or vagina, or on the eyes. The number of sores can range from one to several thousand. Some people develop inflammation inside the rectum (proctitis) that can cause severe pain, as well as inflammation of the genitals that may cause difficulties urinating.In most cases, the symptoms of mpox go away on their own within a few weeks with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever. However, in some people, the illness can be severe or lead to complications and even death. New-born babies, children, people who are pregnant and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at higher risk of more serious mpox disease and death.   Severe disease due to mpox may include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes, and genitals), secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections. Complications can include severe bacterial infection from skin lesions, mpox affecting the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia), and eye problems. People with severe mpox may require hospitalization, supportive care and antiviral medicines to reduce the severity of lesions and shorten time to recovery. According to available data, between 0.1% and 10% of people with mpox have died. It is important to note that death rates in different settings may differ due to several factors, such as access to health care and underlying immunosuppression.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/monkeypox
cac93e98-0073-4374-89ee-7eb96f9abe65,How does mpox spread?,"From person to person: Mpox spreads from person-to-person through close contact with someone who is infected with the monkeypox virus. Close contact includes being face-to-face (such as talking or breathing close to one another which can generate droplets or short-range aerosols); skin-to-skin (such as touching or vaginal/anal sex); mouth-to-mouth (such as kissing); or mouth-to-skin contact (such as oral sex or kissing the skin). During the global outbreak that began in 2022, the virus mostly spread through sexual contact. People with mpox are considered infectious until all their lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath, and all the lesions on the eyes and in the body (in the mouth, throat, eyes, vagina and anus) have healed too, which usually takes from 2 to 4 weeks. It is also possible for the monkeypox virus to persist for some time on clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. Someone else who touches these items may become infected, particularly if they have any cuts or abrasions or touch their eyes, nose, mouth or other mucous membranes without first washing their hands. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces/objects and cleaning your hands after touching surfaces/objects that may be contaminated can help prevent this type of transmission.The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact.  Although being infected from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, there is still limited information on whether the virus can be caught from people who are infected before they get symptoms or after their lesions have healed. Although live monkeypox virus has been isolated from semen, we do not yet know whether infection can spread through semen, vaginal fluids, amniotic fluids, breastmilk or blood.From animals to humans: Mpox can spread to people when they come into physical contact with an infected animal such as some species of monkeys, terrestrial rodent (such as the tree squirrel). Physical contact can mean through bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping, or cooking. The virus can also be caught through eating infected animals if the meat is not cooked thoroughly. The risk of catching mpox from animals can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In countries where animals carry the virus, any foods containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating.  From humans to animals:There have been a few reports of the monkeypox virus being identified in pet dogs. However, it is not confirmed whether these were true infections, or whether the detection of virus was related to surface contamination. Since many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the monkeypox virus, there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to animals in different settings. People who have confirmed or suspected mpox should avoid close physical contact with animals, including pets (such as cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils), livestock and wildlife. More detailed advice for pet owners and persons working with animals can be found in the WOAH risk guidance on reducing spillback of monkeypox virus.WHO continues to work with its One Health partners the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) to learn more about the natural reservoir of the monkeypox virus and help countries to reduce the risk of monkeypox virus transmission from or to animals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/monkeypox

Anyone living with someone who has mpox should take steps to reduce the risk of becoming infected. A person who has been diagnosed with mpox should be assessed by a health care provider to determine if they are well enough to be cared for at home and if isolation can be safely managed at home.

Anyone who has close contact with someone who has symptoms is at risk and any person with multiple sex partners is also at risk. Most of the cases that were reported in the multi-country outbreak in 2022/2023 were identified among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.  Given that the virus moves from person to person in these social networks in many countries, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men may be at higher risk of being exposed if they have sex or other form of close contact with someone who is infectious. People who have multiple or new sexual partners are currently most at risk.Engaging communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men to raise awareness is essential to protect those most at risk.

If the monkeypox virus is spreading in your area or in your community, have open conversations with those you come into close contact with about any symptoms you or they may have. Avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox, especially sexual contact. Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you think you might have mpox, you can act to protect others by seeking medical advice and isolating from others until you have been evaluated and tested. If you have mpox, you should isolate from others until all your lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath. This will stop you from passing on the virus to others. Follow your local health authority instructions on isolation at home or in a health facility.

People who have sex with multiple or new partners are most at risk. Anyone with new and unusual rashes or lesions should avoid having sex or any other kind of close contact with other people until they have been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mpox. Remember that the rash can also be found in places that can be hard to see inside the body, including the mouth, throat, genitals, vagina and anus/anal area.If mpox is spreading through sex in your community or area, consider reducing your risk until the outbreak is brought under control by: openly communicating with partners about mpox symptoms and risks;exchanging contact details with sexual partners so that you can inform each other if you do develop symptoms; taking a break from having sex;reducing your number of new sexual partners, one off sexual partners, or anonymous sexual partners;consistently using condoms; avoiding group sex;avoiding sex-on-premises venues (such as cruising bars, saunas and darkrooms); and avoiding using alcohol or drugs in sexual contexts (including chemsex). While the monkeypox virus has been found in semen, it is currently not known whether mpox can be spread through semen or vaginal fluids. Wearing a condom won’t fully protect you from mpox, but it may reduce your risk or extent of exposure and it will help protect you and others from HIV and a range of other STIs. People with mpox are advised to use condoms for 12 weeks after they recover.

Follow national advice on whether you should recover at home or if you need care in a health facility. In the meantime, it is important to avoid having close contact with others, including sexual contact.If you are advised to isolate at home, protect those you live with as much as possible by: asking friends and family to help you by delivering things you need;isolating in a separate room; using a separate bathroom, or cleaning any surfaces you touched after each use; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces with soap and water and a household disinfectant;avoiding sweeping/vacuuming (this might disturb virus particles and cause others to become infected); using separate utensils, objects, electronics, or clean well with soap and water/disinfectant before sharing; not sharing towels, bedding or clothes; doing your own laundry (lift bedding, clothes and towels carefully without shaking them, put materials in a plastic bag before carrying it to the washing machine and wash them with hot water over 60 degrees Celsius);opening windows for good ventilation; andencouraging everyone in the house to clean their hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.If you cannot avoid being in the same room as someone else or having close contact with another person while isolating at home, then do your best to limit their risk by: avoiding touching each other;cleaning your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer;covering your rash with clothing or bandages (until you can isolate again – your rash will heal best if uncovered);opening windows throughout the home;ensuring you and anyone in the room with you wear well-fitting medical masks; andmaintaining at least 1 metre of distance from others.If you cannot do your own laundry and someone else needs to do it for you, they should wear a well-fitting medical mask, disposable gloves and take the laundry precautions listed above.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/monkeypox
e1ed58b1-ffa1-41ba-b3ad-04bd884c1a1f,What care does someone with mpox need to recover fully?,"The care someone needs will depend on their symptoms and their risk of developing more severe disease. People with mpox should follow the advice of their health care provider. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks and usually go away on their own or with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever (such as analgesics and antipyretics). It is important for anyone with mpox who is recovering at home to stay hydrated, eat well and get enough sleep. People who are self-isolating should take care of their mental health by doing things they find relaxing and enjoyable, staying connected to loved ones using technology, exercising if they feel well enough and can do so while isolating, and asking for support with their mental health if they need it. People with mpox should avoid scratching their skin and take care of their rash by cleaning their hands before and after touching lesions and keeping skin dry and uncovered (unless they are unavoidably in a room with someone else, in which case they should cover it with clothing or a bandage until they are able to isolate again). The rash can be kept clean with sterilized water or antiseptic. Saltwater rinses can be used for sores in the mouth, and warm baths with baking soda and Epsom salts can ease the discomfort of sores on the body. Paracetamol can be used to help manage the pain caused by lesions, if needed. If stronger pain medicine is needed, advice should be sought from a health care provider.

An antiviral that was developed to treat smallpox (tecovirimat) was approved in January 2022 by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of mpox under exceptional circumstances. Experience with these therapeutics in the context of an outbreak of mpox is growing but still limited. For this reason, their use is usually accompanied by enrolment in a clinical trial or expanded access protocol accompanied by collection of information that will improve knowledge on how best to use them in future. WHO has made a small number of tecovirimat treatments available for compassionate use, particularly for those who have severe symptoms or who may be at risk of poor outcomes (such as those with immune suppression and people living with HIV with advanced HIV disease).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/monkeypox
f72e3834-d9cc-4b31-afa3-9d3c304bad78,Is there a vaccine against mpox?,"Yes. There are three vaccines against mpox. Many years of research have led to the development of newer and safer vaccines for an eradicated disease called smallpox. Three of these (MVA-BN, LC16 and OrthopoxVac) have also been approved for prevention of mpox. Only people who are at risk (for example someone who has been a close contact of someone who has mpox or someone who belongs to a group at high risk for exposure to mpox) should be considered for vaccination. Mass vaccination is not currently recommended. If you are at high risk of exposure to mpox because of an ongoing outbreak in your community, talk to your health care provider about the vaccine options that are available to you. WHO currently recommends vaccines for people who have been close contacts of someone who has mpox, or people who belong to a group at high risk of exposure to mpox.  Vaccines are one tool in our toolbox in protecting communities against mpox and should be used in combination with other public health and social measures.For most people at risk, mpox vaccines provide protection against infection and severe disease. After you have been vaccinated, continue to take care to avoid catching and spreading mpox. This is because it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated.Initial results from several vaccine effectiveness studies are promising, indicating that a good level of protection is provided against mpox following vaccination. Further studies on the use of vaccines for mpox will provide additional information on the effectiveness of these vaccines in different settings.

Symptoms of severe mpox include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections. The data show worst symptoms in people who are severely immunosuppressed.People with advanced HIV disease (late presentation, low CD4 count and high HIV viral load) have an elevated risk of death if they develop severe mpox. People living with HIV who achieve viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment do not appear to be at any higher risk of severe mpox than the general population. Effective HIV treatment reduces the risk of developing severe mpox symptoms in the case of infection. People with untreated HIV and advanced HIV disease may be immunocompromised and therefore be at greater risk of severe mpox. WHO advises countries to integrate HIV and mpox prevention and care. People who are sexually active and who do not know their HIV status are advised to test for HIV, if it is available to them. People living with HIV on effective treatment have the same life expectancy as their HIV negative peers. Severe mpox cases seen in some countries highlight the urgent need to increase equitable access to mpox vaccines and therapeutics, and to HIV prevention, testing and treatment. Without this, most affected groups are being left without the tools they need to protect their sexual health and wellbeing.If you are living with HIV, continue to take your HIV medication as directed. If you think you may have mpox, seek medical advice.If you think you are at risk for mpox or have been diagnosed with mpox, you may benefit from testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Children can be exposed to the virus at home from parents, caregivers, or other family members through close contact. Adolescents who have engaged in sexual activity with someone with mpox can also be exposed. The mpox rash can at first resemble other common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and other viral infections. If a child you are caring for has symptoms that could be mpox, seek advice from a healthcare provider. They will help to get them tested, and to access the care they need.  Children may be at greater risk of severe mpox than adults. They should be closely monitored until they have recovered in case they need additional care. A health worker responsible for the child may advise that they are cared for in a health facility. In this situation, a parent or caregiver who is healthy and at low risk of mpox will be allowed to stay with them.  If you have confirmed or suspected mpox and you are breastfeeding, talk to your healthcare provider for advice. They will assess the risk of transmitting mpox as well as the risk of withholding breastfeeding to your infant. If it is possible for you to continue to breastfeed and have close contact, they will advise you on how to reduce the risk by taking other measures, including covering up lesions. The risk of infection will need to be carefully balanced with the potential harm and distress caused by interrupting breastfeeding and close contact between parent and child.

3fe189c7-61e1-48be-be8c-070823a525b0,What is Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi or (T. cruzi).It is found mainly in Latin American countries, where it is mostly vector-borne. The main vector involved in the transmission of the parasite to humans is a triatomine bug, also known as a ‘kissing bug’. An estimated 6-7 million people are infected worldwide, mostly in Latin America. Chagas disease is clinically curable if treatment is initiated at an early stage. Therefore universal access to prompt diagnosis and care is essential.Once totally confined to the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease has spread to other continents over the last century mainly because of enhanced means of travel and global population movement to and from Latin America.It is estimated that over 12 000 people die every year from clinical manifestations of Chagas disease, and more than 75 million people are at risk of acquiring the disease.Vector control remains the most useful method to prevent infection. Blood screening is vital to avoid infection through transfusion and organ transplantation. Screening and diagnosis in pregnant women and their children are essential control measures.Chagas disease is named after Carlos Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian doctor, who discovered the disease in 1909.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chagas-disease
c2368ff2-e7df-4612-988d-be29ceaf663d,What is the vector of Chagas disease?,"The Chagas disease vector is an insect of the Hemiptera order (adults have wings and fly), Reduviidae family and Triatominae subfamily (which feed on blood at all stages of their development) and mainly from the genera Triatoma, Panstrongylus and Rhodnius, but also from 12 other genera.In the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease is transmitted by several species of the triatomine bugs that typically live in the cracks of poorly constructed dwellings in rural areas and suburban slums in Latin America.The bugs hide during the day and emerge at night to feed on human blood, usually when people are asleep. Other infected triatomine bug species may be found in areas surrounding houses and in wild environments. Exchange of infection is therefore possible in such environment.Distribution of vectorsThe distribution of vectors and wild reservoirs of T. cruzi in the Americas extends from the United States of America to Argentina and Chile (latitudes 46°N to 46°S). Triatomine bugs have also been found outside the Region of the Americas, but up to now none of them have been found to be infected.More than 150 species of triatomine bugs and >100 species of mammals, mostly wild species, maintain T. cruzi infection in nature.With such a wide reservoir, Chagas disease is not eradicable.The vector was first described in 1773 by the Swedish scientist Charles De Geer, through the observation of an insect captured in the old so-called ""Indies"" (assumed to refer to the East Indies, probably Indonesia).Triatomine bug species with the capacity to transmit T. cruzi have been identified since the 18th century along maritime travel routes to parts of Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.Increased global population mobility increased the possibility of establishing vector transmission to areas where Chagas disease was previously non-endemic, especially in Asia, where the vector is naturally abundant, and even infest houses in large numbers.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chagas-disease
422810c9-81da-4c28-bf95-1257c231f95e,How is Chagas disease transmitted?,"In the Region of the Americas, T. cruzi is mainly transmitted to humans through the infected faeces of the blood-sucking triatomine bug, which is the disease vector. This insect normally hides during the day and becomes active at night, when it feeds on human blood.In its search for a blood meal, the bug usually bites an exposed area of the skin (such as the face - hence its common English name, “kissing bug”).Right after its blood meal, it defecates close to the bite. The parasite, T.cruzi found in the faeces of the bug, is transmitted when the person rubs the area of the bite in an instinctive reaction to the itch (caused by the bite), thereby putting the faeces in contact with the bite.The parasite can also be transmitted when the parasite comes in contact with the mucous membrane of the eyes or mouth or through any other skin lesion.Transmission can occur through contaminated food infected with the vector’s faecal matter. This frequently generates oral outbreaks, especially in hot and humid climates.Other means of transmission involve transfusion of contaminated blood and from infected mothers to child during pregnancy or during delivery (congenital transmission). Less frequently, organ transplantation or laboratory accident can result in transmission.Outside the Region of the Americas, transmission does not occur through the faeces of the infected vector, but rather through non-vectorial routes.Cases of infection outside Latin America have been reported among travellers returning from endemic regions, adopted children, migrants and recipients of blood transfusion or organ transplants.Globalisation and increased international travel and trade between endemic and non-endemic countries make Chagas disease a growing concern at the global level.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chagas-disease

During this phase, a high number of parasites circulate in the blood. In most cases, symptoms are absent or mild, but may include fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, cough, difficulty in breathing, liver enlargement , generalized body swelling, diarrhoea, heart inflammation (with chest pain and even heart failure) and, less frequently, meningoencephalitis (with seizures and even paralysis).In less than 50% of people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs can be a skin lesion (chagoma) or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (Romaña sign).The acute phase can occur at any age but is frequently more severe in children aged <2 years, the elderly and in people who are immunosuppressed or in individuals infected with a high number of parasites. Meningoencephalitis is the most frequent manifestation in people suffering from AIDS.Chronic phaseThe acute phase is followed by the chronic phase, during which parasites are hidden mainly in the heart and digestive muscle.Different clinical forms may be observed:the indeterminate form, the most frequent form, asymptomatic and without apparent signs of disease, is typically found immediately after the acute phase and is life-long in most patients;the cardiac form occurs in up to a third of patients, affecting the heart’s electrical conduction system, causing arrhythmia, heart muscle disorder, heart failure and embolisms;the digestive form (generally enlargement of the esophagus and/or the colon), observed in the South of the Amazon basin, ora mixed form that affects the heart, the digestive system and the autonomic nervous system occurs in ≤15% of patients.Depending on cardiac damage, the mortality rate in a period of 10 years may range from 9 to 85%.

To this end a blood wet smear or a blood concentration technique such as microhaematocrit or Strout technique, must be used.Stained preparations, such as malaria films, detect the parasites when parasitaemia is high (acute phase). In the Amazon Basin, microscopy technicians who diagnose malaria have been trained to detect acute individual cases of Chagas disease and, through them, identify possible foodborne outbreaks.During the chronic phase, when the parasite is hidden in target tissues, diagnosis is made via the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi (serological techniques) using serological tests. Some of the most frequently used techniques are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, western blot and rapid diagnostic tests such as immunochromatography.For strict research purposes, molecular tests (qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and parasitological tests (haemoculture and xenodiagnosis – with examination of the faeces of uninfected triatomine bugs that have fed from an infected patient’s blood) may also be used.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chagas-disease

In these situations, treatment is almost 100% effective, and the disease can be completely cured.However, efficacy decreases as the duration of the infection lengthens. Moreover, infants are less likely to have adverse events from treatment but this risk increases with age.Treatment is also indicated for infants with congenital infection and for patients during the early chronic phase.Adults, especially those with the indeterminate form of the disease, should be offered treatment, but its potential benefits in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the long duration and frequent adverse events.During the late chronic phase, when cardiac or digestive manifestations may occur, additional lifelong medical treatment and surgery are usually indicated.As described earlier, the two medicines used for treatment are benznidazole, often the first-line treatment in most countries; and, nifurtimox. The main contraindications to treatment are pregnancy and kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychiatric or neurological disorders.Both nifurtimox and benznidazole are donated to WHO by Bayer AG and Insud Pharma Group, respectively, and are made available mostly free of charge to the national health services of countries requesting these drugs.

Among others, the following are well described determinants:Stigma - Forgotten disease or forgotten population? (Pinto Dias)For a long time, Chagas disease was a strictly found in rural areas, plaguing only certain regions of the countryside, usually characterized by poverty and exclusion.To many, Chagas disease symbolises much more than an illness, almost always associated with poverty in rural areas and impoverished house infested with triatomine bugs.Although the epidemiology of Chagas disease has changed because of migration and globalization, it is still associated with the poverty-stricken hut. Today, the disease is found in cities but the social stigma associated with infection remains strong.The social consequences of stigma can be extremely severe; indeed, infection with T. cruzi can lead to social rejection. Infection can also mean work restriction because its association with poor health and potential difficulties in performing work, and even sudden death, creating a fear of financial losses by employers. For these reasons many people are reluctant to seek screening and medical help, which can lead to more serious complications and further spread of the disease.Emotional burden of Chagas diseaseStudies have shown that local communities in endemic countries do not have a clear understanding of Chagas disease. Instead people in rural areas merge preconceptions, forging an overall mixed and incorrect concept of the disease, its origin and consequences.For many, Chagas disease is not necessarily associated with its vector or its symptoms, but more with feelings of despair, fear of death and suffering.This negative approach drastically affects health-seeking behaviour as people develop adaptive behaviours, such as refusing to get screened thereby compromising both treatment and diagnosis.Chagas disease diagnosis in non-endemic countriesGlobalisation has led to a rise in awareness about Chagas disease as an emerging issue in non-endemic regions.However, many practitioners in non-endemic countries still consider Chagas disease to be a tropical illness restricted to Latin America, and this assumption causes many misdiagnoses when presented with cardiomyopathies or other clinical manifestations of the disease.Similarly, patients infected with T. cruzi in non-endemic countries may not be aware of their condition which can lead to further transmission through blood and organs donation, for instance.Training health personnel to facilitate diagnosis and provide medical care can greatly help to mitigate transmission and improve prognosis.Regulatory practices in some countries require people applying for employment to go through a compulsory T. cruzi serology. Although the aim is to protect patients with Chagas disease, this practice has resulted in discrimination against infected individuals., causing instead, hindrance and stigmatization.Lack of understanding and knowledge of the disease, along with incorrect beliefs, are clear obstacles to promoting health-seeking behaviour.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chagas-disease

7d727c8b-4cbd-4956-8729-a96aadd2a153,What is the history of the IHR?,"In 1951 Member States of WHO issued the first set of International Sanitary Regulations. They included mostly notification and quarantine provisions for outbreaks of six diseases: cholera, plague, relapsing fever, smallpox, typhus, and yellow fever. These Regulations were revised in 1969 and adopted as the International Health Regulations (1969). Their purpose was “to ensure the maximum security against the international spread of diseases with a minimum interference with world traffic”. They were further amended in 1973 to include only four diseases (cholera, plague, smallpox, and yellow fever). Then, after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, the Regulations included only three diseases: cholera, plague, and yellow fever.With the increase in international travel and trade, and the emergence, re-emergence, and international spread of disease and other threats, the World Health Assembly called for a substantial revision to the IHR in 1995. This revision extended the IHR’s scope beyond any specific disease or manner of transmission, to cover “illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source, that presents or could present significant harm to humans”.Other additions included the obligations of States Parties to develop minimum core public health capacities and to notify WHO of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), as well as procedures by which the Director-General could determine a PHEIC and issue temporary recommendations.

are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests,
such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are the most accurate tests for
diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by
amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. Rapid antigen tests
(sometimes known as rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs) detect viral proteins
(known as antigens). RDTs are a simpler and faster option than molecular tests
and are available for testing by trained operators or by the individual
themselves (sometimes called self-tests). They perform best when there is more
virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during
the time they are most infectious, generally within the first 5–7 days
following symptom onset. Samples for both types of tests are collected from the

tests, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection or
vaccination. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks

Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early
stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had
the disease in the past. If you have been vaccinated, many antibody tests are

spread of COVID-19.Quarantine is used for certain persons who are a contact of someone
infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, whether the infected
person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from
others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and
can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means
staying in the facility or at home for several days.
Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested
positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other
people, ideally in a medical facility where you can receive clinical care. If
isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high-risk
group for developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you
have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days. If you are
infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 5 days

However, without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, a case of uncomplicated malaria can progress to a severe form of the disease, which is often fatal without treatment. Malaria is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another; the disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes.  Five species of parasites can cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat. There are over 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes and around 40, known as vector species, can transmit the disease.This risk of infection is higher in some areas than others depending on multiple factors, including the type of local mosquitoes. It may also vary according to the season, the risk being highest during the rainy season in tropical countries.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria

In 2021, an estimated 247 million people contracted malaria in 85 countries. That same year, the disease claimed approximately 619 000 lives. Some people are more susceptible to developing severe malaria than others. Infants and children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk. Other vulnerable groups include people entering areas with intense malaria transmission who have not acquired partial immunity from long exposure to the disease, or who are not taking chemopreventive therapies, such as migrants, mobile populations and travellers.  Some people in areas where malaria is common will develop partial immunity. While it never provides complete protection, partial immunity reduces the risk that malaria infection will cause severe disease. For this reason, most malaria deaths in Africa occur in young children, whereas in areas with less transmission and low immunity, all age groups are at risk.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria
95496287-8b58-473d-922f-2a0335a71e15,What are the symptoms and how is it diagnosed?,"The first symptoms of malaria usually begin within 10–15 days after the bite from an infected mosquito. Fever, headache and chills are typically experienced, though these symptoms may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. In malaria endemic areas, people who have developed partial immunity may become infected but experience no symptoms (asymptomatic infections).WHO recommends prompt diagnosis for anyone with suspected malaria. If Plasmodium falciparum malaria is not treated within 24 hours, the infection can progress to severe illness and death. Severe malaria can cause multi-organ failure in adults, while children frequently suffer from severe anaemia, respiratory distress or  cerebral malaria. Human malaria caused by other Plasmodium species can cause significant illness and occasionally life-threatening disease.Malaria can be diagnosed using tests that determine the presence of the parasites causing the disease. There are 2 main types of tests: microscopic examination of blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests. Diagnostic testing enables health providers to distinguish malarial from other causes of febrile illnesses, facilitating appropriate treatment.  More information on malaria diagnostic testing",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria
f2d5b224-a62b-480f-a35d-87dd11be41f0,What treatments are available for malaria?,"Malaria is a treatable disease. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the most effective antimalarial medicines available today and the mainstay of recommended treatment for
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest malaria parasite globally.
ACTs combine 2 active pharmaceuticals with different mechanisms of action, including derivates of artemisinin extracted from the plant Artemisia annua and a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites
during the first 3 days of treatment, while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites.As no alternative to artemisinin derivatives is expected to enter the market for several years, the efficacy of ACTs must be preserved, which is why WHO recommends that treatment should only be administered if a person tests positive for malaria.
WHO does not support the promotion or use of Artemisia plant material (whether teas, tablets or capsules) for the prevention or treatment of malaria.Over the last decade, parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines has emerged as a threat in the fight against malaria, particularly
in the Greater Mekong subregion. WHO is also concerned about more recent reports of drug-resistant malaria in Africa. To date, resistance has been documented in 3 of the 5 malaria species known to affect humans:
P. falciparum,  P. vivax, and P. malariae. However, nearly all patients infected with artemisinin-resistant parasites who are treated with an ACT are fully cured, provided the partner drug is highly efficacious.More information about artemisinin resistance",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria

This parasite is also dominant in other malaria hotspots, including the WHO regions of South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific. In the WHO Region of the Americas, the Plasmodium vivax parasite is predominant, causing 75% of malaria cases.The threat of malaria is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and 4 countries in that region accounted for nearly half of all malaria deaths worldwide in 2021: Nigeria (26.6%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%), and Mozambique (4.1%).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria

This includes travellers from non-endemic countries entering areas of high transmission as well as people in malaria-endemic countries living in areas where there is little or no transmission.As symptoms often do not present for 10 to 15 days after infection, travellers may return to their home country before exhibiting signs of the disease. Doctors in non-endemic areas may not recognize the symptoms, causing potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment. In addition, effective antimalarial drugs may not be registered or available in all countries.Chemoprophylaxis can be used as a preventive therapy prior to travelling in endemic areas. When combined with the use of insecticide-treated nets and the repeated application of a topical repellent to prevent mosquito bites, it significantly lowers the risk of infection. If a person has taken chemoprophylaxis as a preventive measure, the same medicine should not be used for treatment if infection occurs. Travellers are encouraged to consult a doctor or their national disease control centre prior to departure to determine the appropriate preventive measures.Chapter on malaria in the WHO “International travel and health”",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria

Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and reduce transmission. Two forms of vector control are effective for people living in malaria-endemic countries: insecticide-treated nets, which prevent bites while people sleep and which kill mosquitoes as they try to feed, and indoor residual spraying, which is the application of an insecticide to surfaces where mosquitoes tend to rest, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings of houses and other domestic structures. For travellers, the use of an insecticide-treated net is the most practical vector control intervention. WHO maintains a list vector control products that have been assessed for their safety, effectiveness and quality.  More information on vector control2.	Chemopreventive therapies and chemoprophylaxis. Although designed to treat patients already infected with malaria, some antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent the disease. Current WHO-recommended malaria chemopreventive therapies for people living in endemic areas include intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, perennial malaria chemoprevention, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for school-aged children.

This vision will be achieved progressively by countries eliminating malaria from their territories and implementing effective measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission.Malaria-endemic countries are situated at different points along the road to elimination. The rate of progress depends on the strength of the national health system, the level of investment in malaria elimination strategies and other factors, including biological determinants, the environment and the social, demographic, political and economic realities of a particular country. Over the last 2 decades, significant progress has been achieved towards malaria elimination.

As many as 1 in 4 tobacco farmers are affected by green tobacco sickness, nicotine poisoning. The disease is caused by nicotine absorbed through the skin from the handling of tobacco leaves. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, increased perspiration, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weakness, breathlessness and more. Exposure to heavy chemicals and nicotine. Tobacco farmers are exposed daily to tobacco dust and other chemical pesticides. A tobacco farmer who plants, cultivates and harvests tobacco may absorb nicotine equivalent to 50 cigarettes per day. Additionally, tobacco farmers often carry harmful substances home on their bodies, clothes or shoes, leading to secondary harmful exposures for their families, especially children. Chronic lung conditions. Tobacco farmers also inhale large amounts of tobacco smoke during the curing process, which increases the risk of chronic lung conditions and other health challenges. Vulnerable populations especially at risk. Women and children are often the primary tobacco labourers and are therefore more exposed to the health risks of handling green tobacco leaves and heavy chemicals as well as exposure to tobacco smoke during the curing process. Children are particularly vulnerable, given their body weight relative to the proportion of nicotine absorbed through their skin. Pregnant women are also disproportionally affected by the harmful effects of tobacco farming and face a higher risk of miscarriage.

af27a21d-4aaa-481c-ba3c-6c12def07911,How does tobacco growing damage the environment?,"Heavy use of pesticides. Tobacco growing is resource-intensive and requires heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers, which contribute to soil degradation. These chemicals escape into the aquatic environment, contaminating lakes, rivers and drinking water. Land used for growing tobacco then has a lower capacity for growing other crops, such as food, since tobacco depletes soil fertility.Deforestation. Tobacco farming accounts for about 5% of total deforestation, further contributing to CO2 emissions and climate change. To make space for tobacco crops, trees must be cut down and land cleared. It takes roughly one tree to make 300 cigarettes. This leads to desertification and hunger as there is limited fertile land to grow food in some of these regions. Approximately 200 000 hectares (ha) of land are cleared for tobacco agriculture and curing each year, which is the equivalent of almost half the area of Cape Verde (403 000 ha). Loss of biodiversity. Tobacco growing contributes to habitat fragmentation, meaning that parts of the habitat are destroyed leaving smaller unconnected areas, which can undermine ecosystems and contribute to loss of biodiversity. It is also associated with land degradation or desertification in the form of soil erosion, reduced soil fertility and productivity, and the disruption of water cycles. Leaching of chemicals into nearby water sources kills fish and affects other humans and animals, including cattle, that access these waters for domestic use and drinking.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco

Limited choice of alternatives. Choices of alternative crops are sometimes limited due to absence of strong assured markets as compared to the tobacco market, as well as of government support to transition away from tobacco growing.Degrading of soil. The tobacco plant and the chemicals required to grow it degrade the soil, and intercropping – the practice of growing two or more crops in close proximity – is a challenge as the soil is depleted of essential nutrients for productive farming.Crop intensity. Tobacco is a labour-intensive crop that takes up to 9 months to mature, which makes it difficult for smallholder farmers to grow food crops within the same year.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco
268ceaae-788b-41a0-9a04-6cc50af7df08,How does tobacco growing impact the household income of farmers?,"Debt. Growing tobacco requires access to supplies and services, such as seed and fertilizer, at the start of the season. The tobacco industry advances these costs, which are then deducted from their payment at the end of the season. Through this process, farmers end up in dependency and debt to transnational tobacco companies or intermediary traders. Under-grading and under-pricing of tobacco leaf. Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries are often contracted to grow tobacco through legal agreements with large transnational companies where the tobacco prices and grades (or quality) are determined by the buyer, leaving farmers little room for negotiation. Transnational tobacco companies forcibly reduce their costs through under-grading, and therefore under-pricing, of farmers’ tobacco leaf. The contractors also determine the cost of the inputs and they are inevitably inflated, further disadvantaging the farmers.Labour intensity. Tobacco growing is a labour-intensive practice, requiring farmers and their families to spend most of their day tending to the plants. The well-documented labour intensiveness of tobacco farming largely explains why smallholder tobacco farmers generally earn very little considering their efforts. When all the days worked by every contributing household member are included, studies show that tobacco farming is less profitable than other crops. Research across several countries suggests that this labour would be more valuable growing other crops.Cost of inputs. The cost of seeds, fertilizers, fuel wood and renting or buying land are expensive and often not factored in when assessing the profitability of tobacco growing. Healthcare costs. Tobacco growing burdens farmers with health issues that can be unique to tobacco growing, such as green tobacco sickness, increasing the overall household healthcare costs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco

The tobacco industry keeps farmers dependent by providing them with incentives, such as loans or supplies needed to grow tobacco like seeds and agrochemicals. Often under contractual arrangements with the tobacco industry, farmers are then trapped in a vicious circle of debt, unable to get a fair price for their product.

Philip Morris International (PMI) launched a zero deforestation and no natural ecosystem conversion programme operated to protect natural habitats, particularly biodiversity sites of global importance and protected areas in 2022. Meanwhile, tobacco accounts for about 5% of total deforestation. Corporate responsibility schemes. The tobacco industry has set up several organizations and programmes which aim to support the livelihoods of tobacco-growing communities through crop diversification methods and schemes that aim to improve living standards of farmers. Introducing new crops while continuing to grow tobacco does not eliminate the risks of tobacco growing. These efforts divert public attention away from the real costs of tobacco farming such as poor health outcomes, environmental degradation and poverty. Pretending to protect children while perpetuating child labour. An estimated 1.3 million children globally participate in tobacco farming practices. Children from poor households miss school to support their families’ tobacco farming practices and boost income. These tasks often include mixing and applying pesticides, harvesting tobacco leaves by hand and tying them to sticks to dry, and sorting and classifying dried tobacco, thereby exposing them to both harmful chemicals and nicotine. Nonetheless, the tobacco industry gives a false impression of fighting child labour by undertaking so-called corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, and self-reporting their anti-child labour initiatives which are largely based on the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing (ECLT) Foundation which hosts board members from Japan Tobacco International (JTI), Imperial Brands, and British American Tobacco (BAT) amongst others.   Lobbying with policy makers.

In several countries, it is easy to get crop loans (or get crop insurance) for tobacco crops, sometimes with no collateral.Direct subsidies often incentivize and influence farmers to grow tobacco crops only because of the subsidies. As a result, more tobacco is produced than can be absorbed by the free market. Not only does this undermine the livelihoods of farmers, but it also costs government more money and drives the prices of tobacco down.Available data from the World Trade Organization demonstrate that several countries offer direct tobacco subsidies, including some high-income countries like the United States of America and Switzerland (US$ 142.8 million and US$ 4.57 million (4.2 million Sw.fr.) in 2021, respectively).

f2fbcd63-400c-466d-878d-0e4cc9a0736d,How can tobacco farmers be supported to shift to alternative crops?,"Governments in tobacco growing countries. Governments should accelerate the implementation of Articles 17 and 18 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and its guidelines that outline how governments can support farmers by offering technical advice on agriculture to farmers, linking them to necessary supplies and services to support their agricultural production, providing financial support to increase production of healthy food, and divesting away from tobacco and towards alternative crops. Seek political support for programmes to support farmers to shift to alternative livelihoods.Initial subsidies of supplies (quality seeds, fertilizers or farm equipment) to incentivize famers to make the shift until they have the financial means to sustain it on their own, especially given that supplies are a key factor in farmers’ decision to enter into contract with tobacco leaf buying companies. Extension services in the form of training and technical advice on agriculture, as well as support for farmers to access the necessary supplies and services for agricultural production, thereby increasing income. Programmes to better connect farmers to buyers of healthy, resilient, local and sustainable crops, so that they can be assured a viable market when moving away from tobacco.Support the development of farmers’ cooperatives to help in creating a robust information exchange and knowledge transfer mechanism and mitigate risk for shifting to non-tobacco crops.Support diversification strategies that are demand driven and pursue policies based on market dynamics.Hold the tobacco industry accountable for the risks posed to the environment and the health effects of tobacco cultivation and manufacturing.Working with government departments of public health and local government officials to sensitize farmers to the benefits of shifting away from tobacco and what alternatives are available.Develop community-based champions to lead the shift.Read more on country practices in the implementation of Article 17  here.Governments in countries that do not grow tobacco and only import tobacco leaf. Governments should recognize the additional burden placed on low- and middle-income countries to grow tobacco for consumption in high-income countries. High income countries that import tobacco need to incorporate tobacco control, including for alternative livelihoods to tobacco, as part of their development cooperation strategies. They must support alternative livelihood to tobacco growing initiatives which align with other commitments to support the health, environment and economies of low- and middle-income countries and least developed countries. Advocacy groups in tobacco growing countries. Groups should develop and share global and regional best practices, as well as educational programmes and information campaigns backed by data and evidence to prevent any attempt of the tobacco industry to misinform farmers and to help promote viable options available to tobacco growers and workers to shift to sustainable alternative livelihoods. They can also generate awareness amongst farmers to understand the negative health, environmental, social and economic effects associated with tobacco growing. For example, various initiatives under the Digital India Programme by the Government such as “Digital Village”,”Common Service Centres”, “e-Health”, e-education” etc. can be used for education, awareness and advocacy for tobacco farmers. Advocates from tobacco importing countries. Advocates are encouraged to call out the government for supporting tobacco production in low- and middle-income/least developed countries, especially those that are facing food insecurity and contributing to global food crisis, and for not walking the talk on tobacco control including alternative livelihoods as part of development cooperation.Civil society. Civil society organizations can expose industry efforts to impede efforts to support tobacco farmers to shift to alternative livelihoods as well as their efforts to greenwash their tactics.Microfinance institutions. Microfinance institutions can ensure that rural credit programmes benefit tobacco growers who are looking to shift so they can be supported to purchase inputs needed to grow alternative crops.UN Agencies. UN Agencies should work together to address SDG Targets 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 (improve food security and nutrition), SDG Target 3a (implementation of WHO FCTC), SDG Target 13 (combat climate change) and SDG Target 17 (strengthen partnership for sustainable development). This can be achieved by establishing enabling crop production and marketing ecosystems to support farmers to shift from tobacco to alternative crops.Private sector market players. Private sector market players can help shape the market for sustainable alternative crops by incentivizing farmers who shift by providing support along the value chain, including on inputs, post-harvest handling, aggregation and offtake.Other resources:Tobacco and its environmental impact: an overviewTobacco: poisoning our planetStatus of tobacco production and trade in AfricaCountry practices in the implementation of Article 17 Policy options and recommendations: Articles 17 and 18 Launch of Tobacco-Free Farms in Kenya",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco

This type of test is widely used to diagnose many types of infections. At this time, PCR tests are the only method recommended to test for mpox.  There are rapid tests in development that detect antigens (proteins) that are part of the virus. It is not known at this time how easily these antigens are detected, in which samples, or when in the course of infection they may be detected; therefore, we don’t yet know if rapid tests are accurate. Research is ongoing to understand whether and how well antigen tests can be used and with which samples. Because of this, antigen tests should not be used for testing of active infection with the monkeypox virus at this time.   The immune response following infection with monkeypox virus can be checked through antibody tests (sometimes called serological tests). As these tests do not detect the virus itself, they only indicate that you have been exposed to the virus and are not recommended as the sole test for the diagnosis of mpox.

They may happen if the sample was collected quite early or late in the course of the illness, as there may have been less virus in the sample. This means that although the test result is negative you might have mpox infection.    Results from other sample types, such as throat, genital, anal or rectal swabs, may be less accurate than samples taken from lesions, but research is ongoing to understand these better.   Generally, a positive result for these can be trusted and it means you are infected; a negative result doesn’t necessarily mean you do not have mpox, as the amount of virus in these samples may be lower and therefore infections can be missed.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities

The use of sharp instruments carries a risk of injury and contamination and should be avoided unless appropriate safety measures are in place.  Before specimen collection, it is important to ensure that all appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) has been properly worn and fitted. In addition, it is important to communicate clearly to the patient what they should expect in terms of procedure but also discomfort. This will help avoid unexpected reactions. See WHO’s clinical and IPC guidance for mpox for more information. If available and appropriate, you can also consider getting vaccinated, as additional protection against infection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/testing-for-mpox--health-workers
8c8f0945-46ff-4aa9-a90f-dd51fdb50eac,How do I encourage testing for someone who might have mpox?,"To help encourage testing, it is important to build and maintain trust with your communities and ensure that services are free from stigma and discrimination. It should be emphasized that testing for mpox is voluntary and just one part of a package of support which includes counselling, referral for medical care and social support where available.  When individuals seek medical advice around mpox, equip them with adequate information by explaining clearly how testing works and what it entails. Understand that people may only come for testing if they have severe symptoms like pain and multiple lesions.  Helping inform at-risk communities about mpox including signs, symptoms, and how it can be passed on to others through close contact can help encourage open conversations around risks and testing. Encourage your clients to raise awareness in their communities for people with symptoms and close contacts to seek health advice.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/testing-for-mpox--health-workers

Here are some considerations:  Providing easy to understand information about home care and medical support services can be empowering for individuals.  A positive test result should lead to referral for medical care and counselling services. Understanding what is available and how clients can access these services is important.   Follow up is important especially for people recovering at home in isolation – ensure that clients are engaged with follow up contact and support.   For negative test results it is also important to advise your client that it does not necessarily mean they are not infected.

an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB), representing all regions of the world, to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, with a view to adoption under
Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, or other provisions of the Constitution as may be deemed appropriate by the INB.Article 19 gives the 194 Member States forming the Health Assembly the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on any matter within WHO’s competence. The sole instrument established under Article 19 to date is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which has made a significant and rapid contribution to protecting people from tobacco since its entry into force in 2005.The World Health Assembly decision establishing the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) and its work on this new international accord stressed that WHO’s Member States, who will be working in their sovereign capacity, should guide their efforts
by the principle of solidarity with all people and countries, and that the accord should frame practical actions to deal with both causes and consequences of pandemics and other health emergencies.In support of the INB process, inputs were solicited from the main constituencies as follows:written and oral inputs from Member States and relevant stakeholders on the successive iterations of the work, including the Substantive Elements, the Working Draft, the Conceptual Zero Draft and the Zero Draft; regional consultations during the WHO Regional Committees of 2022;informal, focused consultations on selected key issues, including with experts, in the second half of 2022; and public hearings (two rounds, in April and September 2022), for interested parties and stakeholders to express their views. From the Conceptual Zero Draft to the Zero DraftThe Conceptual Zero Draft (CZD), presented at the third meeting of the INB, in December 2022, was not intended as an official/formal draft of the accord and was not presented
for “negotiation”, “agreement” or otherwise to be “approved” by WHO’s Member States. It was intended as a “bridge”, for reflexion on, by Member States, between the Working Draft presented at the
Second meeting of the INB and the Zero Draft, to be considered at the fourth meeting of the INB, beginning on 27 February 2023.After reviewing the CZD at the third meeting of the INB in December 2022, Member States agreed that the INB Bureau should move ahead with developing a Zero Draft (ZD) of a potential pandemic accord based on inputs received.The Zero Draft is available on the INB website in all six official UN languages.Zero draft of the pandemic accordThe INB has been requested to deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023 - which is expected to be of a procedural nature and to be addressed at the fifth meeting of the INB.The INB is expected to submit a draft pandemic accord for consideration by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in 2024.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord

Many countries had to delay community-based interventions such as preventive chemotherapy or active case-finding, while access to health-facility services dropped because of movement restrictions for both health staff and patients. For example, in 2020, the number of people reached by mass treatment interventions dropped to 798 million from 1.207 billion in 2019. Although a resumption of activities has occurred in 2021, the observed recovery is still partial and far from pre-COVID-19 levels. The need to address the COVID-19 emergency has also determined a reprioritization of resources to other areas, in cash and kind.

While this model has driven significant progress, as we move forward it is imperative that these investments are complemented with more sustainable approaches and a stronger country ownership. There is a need to increase the sustainability and predictability of funding as well as the availability of medicines and diagnostics across the whole NTD spectrum, to ensure a progressive strengthening of NTD programmes and services along the three dimension of Universal Health Coverage (maximizing who is covered, which services are covered, and the proportion of the costs covered). How can we do that? A new investment rationale, complementing the road map, highlights the need to sustainably support cost-efficient interventions. It challenges the global community to invest in cross-cutting interventions outside of the health sector, in areas including water, sanitation and hygiene; education; agriculture; animal welfare; and finance. All these sectors impact the lives of those living in areas endemic for NTDs and are important as part of a holistic, sustainable approach. Ultimately, NTD interventions need to be a routine part of national systems and services to preserve the progress made, continue protecting those benefiting from services, and expand services where needed.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/neglected-tropical-diseases

HIV is fully preventable; different interventions exist to stop transmission. However, many people are not accessing necessary information and skills to prevent HIV. In some cases, major legal and social barriers prevent people from accessing effective prevention services and measures. Some populations are at higher risk of HIV infection, including men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs; People in prisons and other closed settings; sex workers and their clients; and transgender people. These populations are referred to as ‘key populations’, who are often marginalized in communities and experience major barriers in accessing HIV prevention and treatment and other health services.

The probability of infection by HIV or other sexually transmitted pathogens significantly increases when people engage in risky sexual behaviours (e.g. no condom use, unprotected sex with multiple partners; sex under the influence of drugs and alcohol). Additionally, sores and inflammations from some STIs facilitate HIV infection. Evidence indicates that genital herpes (HSV-2) almost triples the risk of acquiring HIV in both men and women.

There is some evidence that being immunocompromised may increase your risk of becoming infected if you are exposed, and of having serious illness or dying from mpox. However, more data is needed to understand this fully.Many people with mpox in the current outbreak are also living with HIV, but there have been relatively few severe cases of mpox, likely because in most cases their HIV infection was well-controlled. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a high prevalence of HIV infection (52%; 14 573/28 006) has been reported among cases with known HIV status. Monkeypox and HIV share common behavioural risk factors such as transmission through sexual contact. Consideration should be given to testing any person with monkeypox infection for HIV infection if their status is not already known.People with multiple sexual partners, including people who are living with HIV, are encouraged to take steps to reduce their risk of being exposed to mpox by avoiding close contact with anyone who has symptoms and by avoiding high-risk situations where multiple contacts may occur even with persons who may not realize they have mpox.

b6ca2c97-0846-4e1d-aba9-a10d0864285e,What is artemisinin and how is it used for the treatment of malaria?,"Isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, artemisinin and its derivatives are powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium parasites in the blood of patients with malaria.Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO as the first- and second-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria as well as for chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria. ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin derivatives include artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin) with a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the first 3 days of treatment (reduction of parasite biomass), while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites (cure).WHO currently recommends 6 different ACTs (*). Two injectable treatments, artesunate or artemether, are recommended for the treatment of severe malaria and should be followed by an ACT when the patient can tolerate oral therapy.Increased access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has been integral to the remarkable success in reducing the global malaria burden over the last 15 years. Almost 3.8 billion treatment courses of ACT were sold globally by manufacturers over the period 2010–2021. An estimated 68% of these procurements were reported to have been distributed to the public sector in malaria endemic countries.* Artesunate-amodiaquine; artesunate-mefloquine; artesunate-pyronaridine; artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine; artemether-lumefantrine; dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/artemisinin-resistance
f6e6a065-078f-4ce7-9bab-cdfb62cb5087,What is the definition of “artemisinin partial resistance”?,"Artemisinin partial resistance typically refers to a delay in the clearance of malaria parasites from the bloodstream following treatment with an ACT. As a result, the artemisinin compound is less effective in clearing all parasites within a 3-day period among patients who are infected with artemisinin partial resistant strains of malaria. Studies have demonstrated that the mechanisms of resistance developed by the parasites against artemisinin compounds affect only one stage of the malaria parasite cycle in humans: the ring stage. It is therefore more appropriate to call the delayed clearance “partial resistance” to highlight this time-limited and cycle-specific feature. It is unknown whether artemisinin partial resistance could further evolve to affect other stages of the parasites, developing into complete resistance. “Full” artemisinin resistance has not been reported.Currently, even if patients are infected with artemisinin partial resistant parasites, nearly all patients treated with an ACT are fully cured provided that the partner drug is highly efficacious in that geographical area. In the absence of partner drug resistance, artemisinin partial resistance rarely leads to treatment failure. Furthermore, there is no evidence that artemisinin partial resistance alone has resulted in an increase in malaria morbidity and mortality in the Greater Mekong subregion.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/artemisinin-resistance
46e18c40-d9e6-457c-85c3-2108b238d17b,What are the current molecular markers of artemisinin partial resistance?,"Artemisinin partial resistance is seen as delayed parasites clearance after treatment with a drug containing artemisinin. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that mutations in the PfKelch13 BTB/POZ and propeller domain (PfK13) are associated with this delayed parasite clearance. To date, more than 260 non-synonymous PfK13 mutations have been reported. However, not all the non-synonymous PfK13 mutants reported are associated with artemisinin partial resistance; mutants can also represent genotypes arising de novo but not being selected for.Different PfK13 mutations have varying effects on the clearance phenotype. WHO has established a list of candidates or associated and validated markers of artemisinin partial resistance. The criteria for classification of PfK13 markers of artemisinin partial resistance are shown in the box below.Candidate or associated PfK13 markers of artemisinin partial resistanceA statistically significant association (p <0.05) between a PfK13 mutation and clearance half-life >5 hours or day 3 parasitaemia via a chi-squared test or appropriate multivariable regression model on a sample of at least 20 clinical casesORSurvival of >1% using the RSA0–3h in at least five individual isolates with a given mutation or a statistically significant difference (p <0.05) in the RSA0–3h assay between culture-adapted recombinant isogenic parasite lines, produced using transfection and gene editing techniques, which express a variant allele of PfK13 as compared with the wild-type alleleValidated PfK13 markers of artemisinin partial resistanceBoth requirements 1 and 2 are metThe list of validated and candidate markers is continually being updated. The current list is provided below; all are located in the PfK13 BTB/POZ and propeller domain. Outside these domains, 2 mutations were reported frequently in clinical studies: K189T and E252Q. E252Q has been associated with delayed clearance, but in vitro this association appears to be dependent on other mutations.

The molecular marker allows for a more precise mapping and monitoring of the geographical distribution of resistance. The identification of a K13 mutation in Guyana and in Papua New Guinea has raised concern and prompted further studies In Guyana, the mutation has not been identified in more recent samples and may have disappeared.  Artemisinin partial resistance likely first emerged in the GMS prior to 2001, and prior to the widespread deployment of ACTs.

Such studies done at regular intervals at the same sites allow for the early detection of declines in drug efficacy, providing evidence for guiding national malaria treatment policies.While artemisinin partial resistance alone rarely leads to treatment failure, in the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) there is also resistance to a number of the ACT partner drugs. As a consequence, several ACTs are failing in the GMS. Managing the drug resistance situation requires close monitoring but there are still ACTs available, capable of treating patients even in the areas where the drug resistance is worst. In Eritrea, Rwanda, and Uganda where artemisinin partial resistance has been confirmed, the ACTs tested are still efficacious. In other areas of Africa, a few TES studies have reported treatment failures from studies with artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.

With technical guidance from WHO, all GMS countries have developed national malaria elimination plans that are aligned with the subregional strategy. As countries implement these plans, WHO is providing ongoing technical support through its 5 GMS country offices, regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, and the Organization’s headquarters in Geneva.Furthermore, in 2017, WHO launched the Mekong Malaria Elimination (MME) programme.

An immediate priority is to provide support to improve the phenotypic and genotypic surveillance to better map the extent of the resistance. Plans are being developed to help countries address issues that could cause resistance to spread.  Artemisinin partial resistance has likely occurred as a consequence of several factors: poor treatment practices, inadequate patient adherence to prescribed antimalarial regimens, and the widespread availability of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard forms of the drug.Scaling up interventions will require considerable financial resources, long-term political commitment, and strong cross-border cooperation. One of the most urgent challenges is to strengthen pharmaceutical market regulation and remove oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard medicines from markets. In November 2022, WHO launch a new Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. The strategy aims to tackle drug resistance through, among other actions, tracking its spread, identifying the populations most at risk, and developing viable alternative treatments.ACTs remains the best available treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, and it is imperative that the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance does not lead health care providers or patients to hesitate to prescribe and use ACTs to treat confirmed malaria.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/artemisinin-resistance

The estimates of target population depend on the availability of recent quality censuses and, in some countries, the completeness and timeliness of birth registration;Surveys can be affected by multiples biases. Notably, some areas of difficult access or vulnerable populations may be not included in surveys. Also, where documented evidence of vaccination is not available, survey may have to rely on caregiver recall of the vaccines received by their child;Globally, the number of surveys conducted by the countries decreased, and more so in the last two years;The implementation of surveys has been decreasing, and especially in the Region of the Americas.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage

cb45e859-90cf-4738-a285-a636f15a095f,What is the UV index?,"The UVI is a measure of the level of UV radiation.The values of the index range from zero upward - the higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur.The UVI is an important vehicle to alert people about the need to use sun protection.A marked increase in the incidence of skin cancer in fair-skinned populations worldwide is strongly associated with excessive UV radiation exposure from the sun and possibly artificial sources such as sunbeds. Current evidence indicates that personal habits in relation to sun exposure constitute the most important individual risk factor for UV radiation damage.The UV Index is an important vehicle to raise public awareness of the risks of excessive exposure to UV radiation, and to alert people about the need to adopt protective measures. As part of an international effort, the UV index was developed by WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Meteorological Organization and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. Encouraging people to reduce their sun exposure can decrease harmful health effects and significantly reduce health care costs.The INTERSUN programme promotes the harmonized use of the UVI, and advises governments to employ this educational tool in their health promotion programmes. WHO encourages dissemination channels such as the media and tourism industry to publish the UVI forecast and promote sun protection messages.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-ultraviolet-(uv)-index
cd336bd2-62ae-4cc8-8e50-a325ee9b33c5,What does the UV index mean?,"The levels of UV radiation and therefore the values of the index vary throughout the day. In reporting the UVI, the maximum daily UV level, which occurs during the four-hour period around solar noon, is provided on a given day. . Depending on geographical location and whether daylight saving time is applied, solar noon takes place between noon and 2 p.m. In some countries, sun protection times may also be issued when UV levels levels are forecast to be 3 or higher. At these levels there is an increased risk of skin damage, and protective measures are recommended. How can the UV index help me to protect myself?The UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices.Most people are used to adjusting their daily plans and choice of clothing to the weather forecast, especially to temperature predictions. Analogous to the temperature scale, the UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices.Step 1: Find out today’s UV IndexStep 2: Check out the recommended sun protection.UV index  Action 0 to 2 You can safely enjoy being outside! 3 to 7 Seek shade during midday hours! Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen and slap on hat! 8 and above Avoid being outside during midday hours! Make sure you seek shade! Shirt, sunscreen and hat are a must! Even for very sensitive fair-skinned people, the risk of short-term and long-term UV damage below a UVI of 2 is limited, and under normal circumstances no protective measures are needed. If sun protection is required, this should include all protective means, i.e. clothing, hat and sunglasses, shade and sunscreen.Where is the UV index reported?In many countries the UVI is reported along with the weather forecast in newspapers, on TV,  radio; internet and mobile applications.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-ultraviolet-(uv)-index

aa839d64-54c9-483c-ac12-8df9ccbd4ff7,Why should people donate blood?,"Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients. There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed. Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood
aa62b5f9-e5d3-49f4-a865-c6b564ed795a,What happens when I give blood?,"Whether you are a first-time or regular donor, the blood service must make sure that you will come to no harm by donating blood. This includes checking your blood to be sure it will be safe for the person who receives it. Before you give blood, you will be asked questions about your medical history, including any medication you are taking, and about your current health and lifestyle. You may also be asked about recent travel; for example, if you live in a country where there is no malaria, you may be asked whether you have recently visited a tropical country. These questions will be asked only to safeguard your own health and the health of the person receiving your blood. You will be told whether you are eligible to give blood and, if not, whether you may be able to donate blood in the future. Any personal information that you give will be kept confidential and will not be used for any other purpose. It is very important to be truthful about any reasons why your blood might not be suitable. Although blood is always tested for infections that can be transmitted by transfusion, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, a test may not be able to detect a very recent infection. This means that even though the blood may test negative for a particular infection, it might still infect a patient receiving a blood transfusion. After answering the questions you will also be given a brief medical examination that may include checking your pulse and blood pressure and ensuring that your weight meets a certain minimum. A drop of blood will then be taken from your fingertip to check that giving blood will not make you anaemic. Your health is very important to the blood transfusion service and blood will not be taken unless you can safely give a donation that day. Donating blood is very simple. You will be made as comfortable as possible, usually in a special chair or on a bed. The area inside one of your elbows will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution before a trained health worker inserts a sterile needle, connected to a blood collection bag, into your vein. It usually takes about 10 minutes to donate blood. After resting for 10 or 15 minutes and taking some refreshment, you will be able to return to your normal activities, although you should avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. You should drink plenty of fluids over the next 24 hours.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood

b2d7a28c-3cfb-4820-922f-7c624eacd883,Who should not give blood?,"The blood service is concerned with the welfare of both the blood donor and the recipient (patient).  Donors are often asked not to donate blood for a period of time in the interests of their safety and/or that of the blood supply. You should not give blood if your own health might suffer as a result. The first concern of the blood service is to ensure that blood donation does no harm to the blood donor. You should not donate blood if:You are feeling unwellYou are anaemicYou are pregnant, have been pregnant within the last year or are breastfeedingYou have certain medical conditions, which might make you an unsuitable donor  You are taking certain medications, such as antibiotics. You may be able to donate blood at a later time. In some cases, however, in order to protect your own health you will not be able to donate blood. You should not donate blood if it might cause harm to the patient who receives it. Blood can transmit life-threatening infections to patients who receive blood transfusions. You should not donate blood if:You have or may recently have contracted a sexually transmitted disease, such as HIV or syphilis, that can be passed on to a patient who receives your bloodYour lifestyle puts you at risk of contracting an infection that can be transmitted through your blood: for example, if you have more than one sexual partner or have sexual contact with prostitutesYou have ever injected recreational, non-medicinal drugsYou have recently had a tattoo, skin scarification or ear or body piercing – your local blood service can tell you how long you must wait before giving bloodYou have had sexual contact with anyone in the above categories.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood

As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed only recently,  in settings where deferrals would not compromise blood supply availability, the National Blood Transfusion Service may consider implementing a precautionary deferral period of up to seven days  to minimize the impact of call-backs from donors who develop symptoms subsequent to donating soon after vaccination.Recipients of live virus vaccines (e.g., virus vector based or live-attenuated virus vaccines) should be deferred for four weeks, consistent with current practices.Persons who feel unwell after receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should be deferred for seven days after complete resolution of symptoms, or as specified after receipt of a virus vector-based or live-attenuated vaccine, whichever is the longer period.In situations where it cannot be established whether the donor received a live virus vaccine, a four-week deferral period should be applied.For more detailed information, please refer to:  Maintaining a safe and adequate blood supply and collecting convalescent plasma in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Interim guidance) (17 February 2021):  https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-BloodSupply-2021-1",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood

In some cases, acute hepatitis B or C infection may lead to chronic infection and cause scarring, loss of function, or cancer. Acute hepatitis is a more serious condition in adults than children. Adults show signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and fatal outcomes are higher in older age groups.  The majority of young children do not experience any noticeable symptoms and few develop jaundice. It can pass quickly without need for special care or treatment, but it can occasionally lead to acute liver failure and even death.

form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine
delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars and e-pipes.
ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions.E-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other
toxic substances that are harmful to both users, and non-users who are exposed
to the aerosols second-hand. Some products claiming to be nicotine-free (ENNDS)
have been found to contain nicotine.The consumption of nicotine in children and adolescents has
deleterious impacts on brain development, leading to long-term consequences for
brain development and potentially leading to learning and anxiety disorders.Nicotine is highly addictive and some evidence suggest that
never-smoker minors who use ENDS can double their chance of starting to smoke
tobacco cigarettes later in life. Evidence reveals that these products are harmful to health
and are not safe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the
long-term impact of using them or being exposed to them. Some recent studies
suggest that ENDS use can increase the risk of heart disease and lung
disorders. Nicotine exposure in pregnant women can have similar
consequences for the brain development of the fetus.ENDS use can also expose non-smokers and bystanders to
nicotine and other harmful chemicals.Electronic delivery systems have also been linked to a
number of physical injuries, including burns from explosions or malfunctions,

to an outbreak of lung injury in the USA. This is described by the United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as e-cigarette or
vaping associated lung injury (EVALI), which led the CDC to activate an
emergency investigation into EVALI on 17 September 2019. The CDC notes, “As of 18 February 2020, there have been a
total of 2,807 cases of EVALI reported from all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, including 60 deaths confirmed
in 27 states and the District of Columbia. While the cause of these deaths has
not been conclusively determined, vitamin E acetate (VEA), a common additive in
ENDS that contains cannabis (or THC), is thought to have played a significant
role in these cases of lung injury. Further information on this incident,
including a strong link of the EVALI outbreak to Vitamin E Acetate and the
latest report, is available at https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html,

characteristics, how the products are used, including frequency of use, how the
products are manufactured, who is using the product, and whether product
characteristics are manipulated post-sale.Toxicity is not the only factor in considering risk to an
individual or a population from exposure to ENDS emissions. These factors may
include the potential for abusing or manipulating the product, use by children
and adolescents who otherwise would not have used cigarettes, simultaneous use

affects the lungs. Smoking tobacco is also a known risk factor for severe
disease from many respiratory infections, including coronaviruses SARS (first
identified in 2003) and MERS-CoV (first documented in June 2012). Smoking also
impairs the immune system and previous studies have established that tobacco
use is linked with poorer outcomes for people with TB and pneumonia. Evidence indicates that smokers are more likely to suffer
more severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as admission into intensive care units
and death, than never smokers.  Furthermore,
severe forms of COVID-19 or deaths due to COVID-19 are more frequent in people
with comorbidities that are related to tobacco use, including COPD, lung cancer

The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a daily basis on the COVID-19 dashboard. The WHO Emergency Use Listing process determines whether a product can be recommended for use based on all the available data on safety and efficacy and on its suitability in low- and middle-income countries. Vaccines are assessed to ensure they meet
acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy using clinical trial data, manufacturing and quality control processes. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product
against any potential risks.In line with their national regulations and legislation, countries have the autonomy to issue emergency use authorizations for any health product.  Domestic emergency use authorizations are issued at the discretion of countries and not subject to
WHO approval.As of 12 January 2022, the following vaccines have obtained EUL:The Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine, 31 December 2020.

COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. There is also some evidence that being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you. Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family, friends and anyone else you may come into contact with. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination. There is also still a chance that you could also pass the virus on to others who are not vaccinated. Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines
7ca8228e-a1e0-4b90-b48a-6e7b2177c302,Who should get vaccinated against COVID-19?,"WHO recommends that while vaccine supply is limited, the people at highest risk of COVID-19 are vaccinated first. This includes people who are more likely to get severe disease if they are infected (older persons and people with existing health conditions) and people who are more likely to be exposed to the virus (such as health workers). People who are pregnant have a higher risk of serious illness and preterm birth if they are infected with COVID-19, so WHO recommends that they are also prioritized for vaccination, once the first priority groups have been vaccinated. If you live in a country where vaccines are available to more people beyond these priority groups, get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn. WHO-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people of 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind such as auto-immune disorders. These conditions include hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.The Pfizer vaccine can be safely administered to children from 5 years of age. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are licensed for use in children from 12 years of age. Vaccine trials for the use of other COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation justifies a change in policy.Children and adolescents above 5 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 may be offered vaccination alongside other high priority groups.However, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate healthy children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.

Postpone until you have recovered. You currently have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Wait until you have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms have passed to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people taking blood thinners, but you should let the person giving you the vaccine know about any medication you are taking BEFORE you are given the vaccine.

We are now starting to see evidence that the immunity you get after having COVID-19 can be strong. However, the type of immunity that's developed after infection varies from person to person, making it less predictable than immunity after vaccination. Scientists are working hard to understand this better.What we do know is that COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease that can have long-term consequences. We also know that the WHO-authorised COVID-19 vaccines have been safely given to billions of people. It is much safer to get vaccinated than it is to risk getting COVID-19.

Research is ongoing by thousands of scientists around the world to better understand how new virus mutations and variants affect the effectiveness of the different COVID-19 vaccines.In general, the COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from all current virus variants. They are less effective at protecting you against infection and mild disease than they were for earlier virus variants; but if you do get ill after being vaccinated, your symptoms are more likely to be mild. Remember that while the COVID-19 vaccines authorised by WHO are incredibly effective at reducing your risk of developing serious illness and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. A small percentage of people will still get ill from COVID-19 even though they have been vaccinated. Currently there is limited information about the risk of vaccinated people passing the virus to others if they are infected.

These vaccines are all designed to teach the body’s immune system to safely recognize and block the virus that causes COVID-19.Several different types of potential vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, including:Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines, which use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn’t cause disease but still generates an immune response.Protein-based vaccines, which use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID-19 virus to safely generate an immune response.Viral vector vaccines, which use a safe virus that cannot cause disease but serves as a platform to produce coronavirus proteins to generate an immune response.RNA and DNA vaccines, a cutting-edge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune response.Read more: For more information about all COVID-19 vaccines in development, see COVID-19 vaccine tracker and landscape, which is being updated regularly.The different types of COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines

If you’re offered a different type of vaccine, you can go ahead and get vaccinated. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL vaccine to be a complete primary series, See the full list of COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL here. By mixing and matching vaccines, countries are able to maximise vaccine impact in the event of constrained or limited supply. People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm should be given a third dose to restore waning immunity over time. WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can also be used for the third dose, if the original vaccine is not available.Read more:Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines

This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects don’t go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice. More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

A severe allergic reaction – such as anaphylaxis – is a very rare side effect of any vaccine. If you have a history of allergic reactions, talk to your healthcare provider before you get vaccinated. They will be able to give you advice. In some cases, precautions will need to be taken for people who have known allergies to previous doses of the vaccine or known components of the vaccine. Healthcare workers administering COVID-19 vaccines should be trained to recognise and treat serious allergic reactions. This is why people being vaccinated against COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the vaccination site for a period of time following their injection, to ensure that anyone experiencing an allergic reaction can receive prompt treatment.

If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country.It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Errors related to the delivery of the vaccine can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains.The results of the investigation will then inform next steps.

ded70a39-2923-46ce-8c81-fdb35cf9b2ad,Can I still get COVID-19 after I have been vaccinated?,"Yes. The maximum level of protection from COVID-19 vaccines is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. If you have a two-dose vaccine, this means that you don’t get full immunity until 2 – 4 weeks after the second dose. You can still become infected and ill during this time. While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious illness, hospitalisation and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. As a result, a number of vaccinated people will get infected and may fall ill with COVID-19 in spite of being fully vaccinated. This is known as a ‘breakthrough infection’ or ‘breakthrough case’. With more infectious virus variants such as Delta, we are seeing more breakthrough infections and cases. Breakthrough infections can happen with every vaccine, and do not mean that the vaccine does not work. According to data from the US CDC, unvaccinated people are at 11 times the risk of death from COVID-19 than vaccinated people. People who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated are much more likely to only experience mild symptoms; efficacy against serious illness and death remains high. Get vaccinated, as soon as it’s your turn. Even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures to protect yourself. Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a well fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines

In light of this, WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has advised that booster doses are offered to people 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination is completed. A booster dose should be taken when offered, to strengthen protection against serious illness and death from COVID-19.Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus, so SAGE recommends that boosters are offered to higher priority-use groups before vaccines are given to those in lower-priority use groups.People over 60 and immune-compromised who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm should also be given an additional third dose as part of the primary series to reach sufficient immunity. A booster dose is recommended for these vaccines, for more details consult the interim recommendations.To protect yourself, get vaccinated AND continue practicing the recommended protective behaviours against COVID-19, including regular hand-washing, physical distancing, and ventilation of rooms.Read more:Vaccine efficacy, effectiveness and protection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines

WHO recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should be offered an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine.For Sinovac and Sinopharm, WHO recommends that countries should consider offering a third dose of the vaccine to the vaccination schedule for those aged 60 and over as an extension of the primary series, once a high level of coverage of first and second doses has been achieved in the priority groups.An additional dose is different from a booster dose.

If you are offered a booster you should take it to strengthen your protection against serious disease.  WHO currently recommends that individuals over the age of 18 have 1 booster dose 4-6 months after completing the primary series. WHO does not currently recommend that children and young adults under the age of 18 receive a booster dose. SAGE recommends that high-priority use groups are offered boosters, prior to continuing the roll-out of primary vaccination among lower-priority use groups.

Stay at least 1 metre away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work. WHO does not support using proof of vaccination as a requirement for international travel.

However, drinking alcohol can add to the normal mild to moderate side effects that you might experience after vaccination, such as a headache and tiredness. Because of this, it is advisable to avoid drinking until any side effects following vaccination have passed. Learn more about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness and death, there is still a chance you could be infected after being vaccinated. Continue to protect yourself and others by continuing to practice physical distancing, wear a well-fitted mask over your nose and mouth, clean your hands frequently, stay home if you feel unwell, cover coughs and sneezes and keep indoor spaces well ventilated. Drinking alcohol may make you less vigilant in practicing these behaviours and so can put you and others at risk.

9869a09b-bf5f-4886-a7da-bed3365ae3ff,Can children and adolescents get vaccinated against COVID-19?,"The Pfizer vaccine can be safely administered to children from 5 years of age. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are licensed for use in children from 12 years of age.  WHO recommends that children aged 5 and above with comorbidities that put them at significant risk of severe COVID-19 should be offered vaccination, at a reduced dosage, alongside other high-risk groups. Countries may now consider vaccinating healthy children from the age of 5 years of age and adolescents as part of their national vaccination strategies. However, WHO strongly recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with primary vaccination series has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap. Vaccine trials for children and adolescents and other COVID-19 vaccines are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation justifies a change in policy.COVID-19 has also been a more serious and dangerous disease among older people. While the supply of vaccines is constrained, the ongoing priority is to vaccinate those most at risk of serious illness who still have not been vaccinated in many parts of the world: older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.Most children are at low risk of serious disease and vaccinating them would be primarily about reducing transmission. There is emerging evidence that vaccines may be less effective at reducing transmission of Omicron. This means that the most impactful thing that can be done to protect children while vaccines are still being prioritised for those most at risk is to continue to practice the protective behaviours: keep a safe distance from others and avoid crowds, wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keep indoor spaces well ventilated, clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes.

Excess mortality is defined as the difference between the total number of deaths estimated for a specific place and given time period and the number that would have been expected in the absence of a crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). This difference is assumed to include deaths attributable directly to COVID-19 as well as deaths indirectly associated with COVID-19 through impacts on health systems and society, minus any deaths that would have occurred under normal circumstances but were averted due to pandemic-related changes in social conditions and personal behaviours. Estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic includes deaths from all causes.

In general, reported death numbers under-estimate the number of lives lost due to the pandemic, there are several reasons for this. They miss those who died without testing, they are contingent on the country correctly defining COVID as the cause-of-death and they miss the increases in other deaths that are related to the pandemic leading to overwhelmed health systems or patients avoiding care. A few countries have experienced lower than expected total deaths during the pandemic due to reduced contact and reduced mobility, which have led to reduced infectious disease related mortality as well as reduced transport and injury related fatalities. Reported COVID-19 death numbers do not account for this.In light of the challenges posed by using reported data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, excess mortality is considered a more objective and comparable measure that accounts for both the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic

This is the standard approach followed also by other UN agencies for global estimates. The model adopted for estimating excess deaths is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. WHO in collaboration with the TAG scrutinizes the relationships between excess mortality and certain contextually relevant variables in locations with good quality data to estimate excess mortality in countries with limited data.This approach takes the specificity of countries (e.g., income level, reported COVID-19 deaths rate, test positivity rate, containment index) into consideration while ensuring global comparability.

Countries are classified as Tier 1 countries if complete and nationally representative monthly all-cause mortality data for the specified period have been made available to WHO. Countries categorized as Tier 2 include countries for which WHO does not have access to the complete data and thus requires the use of alternative data sources or the application of scaling factors to generate the national aggregate. For these countries, WHO also utilizes subnational data where available.  Tier classification is not a classification of health systems but one specific for and only applied to this current exercise.

While a natural grouping would be geographically representative, using some regional identification (e.g., WHO regions), from a practical perspective it is not always possible owing to insufficient availability of empirical data in some countries or regions. Even within close geographic proximity, the impact of the pandemic, and its magnitude by sex and age can vary significantly. K-means is a method commonly used to characterize data and partition a data set into groups. Countries are grouped into clusters based on mean ages at death and of population, as well as the overall excess mortality rates and porportion of total deaths. The number of clusters is chosen to maximise the variation between clusters and to minimise the variation within clusters by age and sex. More details on the K-means clustering are provided in the methodology.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic
2ffd181c-be3d-4a31-aea0-f9f04648b751,What are the limitations of these estimates and methods?,"Every model is an approximation of reality. Models are subject to trade-offs, not least, the balance between comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. WHO’s estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also approximations in a rapidly evolving pandemic with regard to transmissibility and severity. It is worth noting that WHO relies on models to compile a wide range of global health statistics. This is necessary as not all countries have high quality information systems, or those that do cannot always share their data in a timely manner. Therefore, WHO works with countries to strengthen their data and health information systems, while at the same time makes the best use of the data currently available to generate high quality evidence. Specifically with regard to the excess mortality estimates, the model uses relationships that have been quantified using data from the countries with high quality systems for data reporting. We extrapolate these relationships to settings that are in many ways systematically different across multiple dimensions such as health systems capacity, underlying disease burden and age-structure. Countries have differed on when they experienced waves and how they responded, and quantifying this temporal relationships between COVID-19 surges or the effects of the emergence of variants is not trivial. In some settings the country responses were reactive but in many others they were proactive. As such, despite the effort to calibrate the model such that it is accurate in different settings, one of the more important limitations to note is that the input data have limited representation and this model generalizes the covariate relationships quantified to settings that may be systematically different from those observed. The final model is intentionally parsimonious. This reduction in complexity means it is not possible for such a reduced set of variables to explain all of the variation that is observed across countries. While the variables chosen are contextually relevant and are found to explain a significant component of the variation in excess, the underlying population characteristics that drove these differences are too complex to fully capture perfectly in a single global model and, hence, the trade-offs referred to above have had to be made. The estimates, therefore, are the best possible at this point in time for the first 24 months of the pandemic and have some degree of uncertainty around them.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic
4be105ac-aee3-4870-98a4-824620da0064,What process did the WHO follow to calculate the estimates?,"In February 2021, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), WHO convened a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on COVID-19 Mortality Assessment to advise on the development of analytical methods for estimating excess mortality in all countries. The COVID TAG is comprised of leading demographers, epidemiologists, data and social scientists and statisticians from a range of backgrounds and geographies.Under Working Group I of the TAG (Working Group I: Global excess mortality estimates including COVID-19), members considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability as well as extensibility, the TAG proposed a Poisson regression model (parameterized to account for over-dispersion) to predict the total number of deaths from all causes for the years 2020 and 2021, conditional on the monthly expected deaths over the period and a predicted relative rate parameter which is modelled using country-specific variables.The model has been used by WHO to generate estimates for countries and regions for which adequate input data were available for reliable inference and to predict estimates for countries with no data available. In addition to determining levels of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for the years 2020 and 2021, the expertise of the TAG is also being leveraged to develop methods for disaggregating the estimated number of excess deaths by age and sex.WHO’s estimates are produced following the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic

and health-related SDGs.
The SCORE for Health Data Technical Package (Survey, Count, Optimize, Review, Enable) identifies data gaps and provides
countries with tools to close them. Based on findings from the first assessment of country health data and information
systems, WHO is using an integrated approach to improve public health and disease surveillance, track Civil Registration
and Vital Statistics (CRVS) data, and optimize routine health information systems, including regular and reliable data from
health facilities.
The following tools are available to countries:
The World Health Survey Plus (WHS+) is a multi-topic, multi-mode, multi-platform survey tool to
gather health data quickly in standardized and cost effective ways to assess and improve health.
The CRVS strategic implementation plan is focused on supporting countries so that over the next five years there will
be substantial progress with accurate and timely tracking of births, deaths, and causes of death.
WHO’s Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS) strategy aims to strengthen RHIS in countries through
strengthened partnerships, improved data collection, and improved integration and interoperability of RHIS, along
with building capacity and ensuring sustainability.
The WHO Toolkit for Routine Health Information Systems Data strengthens facility data analysis through
standardized indicators, visualizations, and guidance, while promoting integrated routing data platforms.
The WHO Harmonized Health Facility Assessment (HHFA) is a comprehensive facility survey providing data on the
availability of health services and the resources and systems needed to improve quality.

b0bcddd1-0a7b-4814-b91b-d662c7598220,"Why is WHO producing these estimates now, in the midst of the pandemic, and what is its utility?","WHO’s
core normative function is to compile and disseminate statistics on
mortality – numbers and causes. The world expects WHO to provide
objective evidence on the impact of COVID-19. Estimating
excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic supplements the traditional
direct measure ‘mortality directly attributable to COVID-19’ with a
broader measure showing the direct plus the indirect effects of the
pandemic.  It
is important to do this now, rather than wait, in order to underpin the
need for an equitable response during the pandemic by showing the real
underlying impact of COVID-19 in different countries – especially lower
and middle income countries that may not have developed health
information systems to guide a targeted response. Deaths
directly attributable to COVID-19 provide only a narrow perspective of
the wide ranging harms being caused by the pandemic. The collateral
damage from COVID-19 is much wider. It is important to quantify this now
as it can inform choices that governments must make regarding
prioritization between routine and emergency health systems.The utility of the excess mortality estimates goes beyond estimation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It underlines the significance of investing in health and better targeting of interventions and resources to those most in need to prevent future deaths. These estimates will serve to underscore to governments around the world the need to sharpen their data tools and specifically improve Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS), mortality surveillance, and data and health information systems.Estimates
of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also critical inputs
for other important work currently underway. For example, pandemic
preparedness and estimating the global population. The UN is mandated to
estimate the global population and prepare population projections.
COVID-19 is a significant disruption to normal population growth trends
and must be factored into any future estimates. Global excess mortality
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provides a key input to this work, showing the
effects of the pandemic on the global population now, but also the
longer tail effects on future population projections. The importance of
this should not be underestimated as population is one of the most
important denominators for economic and social statistics.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic

Substantial increases in mortality in many countries have affected premature mortality and life expectancy. WHO’s excess mortality estimates are critical inputs to WHO global health estimates and other UN partners’ work, including UN World Population Prospects.The excess mortality estimates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide a valuable set of comparable country estimates to better understand the impact of the pandemic. It is thus of vital importance that these estimates are made available in a timely manner and updated periodically in order to identify inequalities and gaps in health information systems and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), which in turn will help in determining likely future vulnerabilities and target interventions.For any questions, please contact: [email protected]",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic

sinuses, throat, lungs. Gases and smaller particles settling in the
middle respiratory tract. Still smaller particles can reach the lower
respiratory tract in the lungs. Pre-existing breathing conditions (e.g.,
asthma, lung conditions from smoking) can worsen if very high levels of
these particles are inhaled over a long period of time. Children and

to remove chemicals from your skin as quickly as possible to prevent
them from being absorbed and from injuring your skin. Clothing provides
some limited and temporary protection from skin exposure and taking off
your clothes will often remove a large proportion of the chemical. Since
contaminated clothing will provide a source of exposure to others e.g.
anyone coming to your assistance, removing your clothes and placing them
in a closable container (e.g. a strong plastic bag) will also protect
other people. You should also try to wash yourself with soap and water,

delivery method can be used to inflict harm. During the 20th century, a
number of groups of chemicals were developed on a large-scale as
weapons. This category of weapon employs the toxicity of their active
components to cause temporary incapacitation, permanent harm or death.
Chemical weapons can be irritants, choking agents, disabling chemicals,
blistering agents, nerve agents, or asphyxiants. Depending on the agent
involved, and on the means for dispersal, chemical weapons can be in
liquid, solid or gaseous forms. The development, stockpiling, transfer

In addition, chemicals may deliberately be introduced into the food chain or water supply. The nerve agents sarin and tabun mix easily with water and, depending on
their concentration in the water, they could cause poisoning if the water was consumed or was used on the skin. These chemicals are not persistent in water, however, and usually degrade over 1-2 days. The nerve agent VX is less soluble but more persistent,
breaking down into a chemical that is toxic by ingestion. In water, mustard agents may form globules surrounded by a protective outer layer. These globules may settle out and may persist for several years, continuing to pose a hazard by contact and
by ingestion.

What should I do to keep myself and others in the household healthy?","It’s hard when someone close to you is unwell. Even though you may want to provide comfort and company to your ill relative, it is important to reduce the likelihood that you or other family members catch COVID-19. For people with mild or moderate
symptoms, the best thing you can do is provide the care they need while also keeping a safe distance.
First of all – protect the health of others in the householdPeople with COVID-19 infection should (where possible) be isolated in a separate room, away from others in the home. If possible, close the door to stop air from moving from the infected person’s room into the rest of the home. If it’s safe,
open windows and turn on a fan in the room if you have one. No other visitors should be allowed in the home when someone in the household has COVID-19 infection. Follow guidance from your country’s health department or ministry about regarding
whether or not close contacts need to isolate at home.If it is not possible to isolate the infected person in your home, try to move people at risk of severe disease to a household where they will not be exposed to possible infection.If you have to share space in your home with someone with COVID-19, open windows to bring in fresh air if it’s safe to do so. COVID-19 spreads easily in places that are poorly ventilated. Learn more about ventilation.
Secondly - protect the health of the person caring for the person with COVID-19 infectionThe spread of the COVID-19 virus occurs most often when an infected person is in close or direct contact with another person. If possible, there should be only one person in the household providing care to the person who has COVID-19 infection.If possible, choose someone to be the caregiver who is healthy and not at high risk. Caregivers should wash their hands before AND after any interaction with the person with COVID-19 infection. Both the caregiver and the person who is infected should
wear a medical mask whenever they share a space with each other. If possible, open windows when the caregiver is in the room with the person with COVID-19 infection.Monitor how you feel.Caregivers and others in a home with a person with COVID-19 infection should pay close attention to how they feel (even if they are vaccinated or are being careful). On average, if takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected for symptoms to show. However,
it can take up to 14 days.Symptoms may vary. Monitor yourself and others in your home for any symptoms of COVID-19 -- including fever, cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, muscle or body ache, headache, running nose, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea or
shortness of breath. Or altered mental status.  Get tested if you have any of these symptoms. Seek immediate medical care if you have any of these severe symptoms of COVID-19: Difficulty breathingChest painConfusionLoss of speech or mobility For young children, seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these symptoms:High feverRapid breathingLethargy or not interacting when awakeDifficulty in feeding (unable to drink or breastfeed) Blue lips or faceIf you think you may have COVID-19 infection and are waiting for test results, avoid contact with other people if possible until you know whether or not you are infected. Watch for warning signs.Pay attention to any changes in the signs and symptoms a person with COVID-19 infection in your care. Some symptoms may be signals that more urgent medical care is needed. Depending on the age of the person in your care, their symptoms may look different.
Adults may look dehydrated, have shortness of breath or chest pains. They may also complain of light-headedness. Children may suddenly appear confused or refuse to eat. Their face or lips may turn blue. Babies may be unable to breastfeed. These symptoms
are warning signs that urgent care is needed.If the person with COVID-19 infection under your care shows any of these signs, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Keep things clean.Any surfaces and household items touched by the person with COVID-19 infection should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day. Household items include dishes, cups and flatware. COVID-19 can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre. A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact
with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1 metre.People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.Continue to practice prevention measures.Keep a distance of at least 1 meter from others;Wear a well-fitted mask over your mouth and nose;Open windowsCough or sneeze into a bent elbow;Clean your hands frequently; andGet vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers

If they are old enough, talk to them about COVID-19 and share accurate information. Reassure your child that their health and safety is your top priority.Be responsive to your child’s needs. Think up ways together for children to stay connected with other family members and friends. Make the space in which the child and caregiver are isolating as child-friendly as possible. Play and learning continue to be an important part of a child’s life. Learn more about helping children hope with stress.Reduce contact with othersThe spread of the COVID-19 virus occurs most often when a person with COVID-19 infection is in close or direct contact with another person.WHO recommends that people with COVID-19 be isolated in a separate room away from other members of the household. However, children should not be isolated on their own. If possible, there should be only one person, who is healthy and not at high risk, in the household providing care to the child with infection. The designated caregiver should take care of the child at all times and monitor their symptoms and safety.The caregiver should wear a medical mask when caring for the infected child and should wash their hands before AND after any interaction with the infected child. If it is possible and safe, keep the room or space well ventilated and open windows frequently. The child with COVID-19 infection should wear a medical mask in shared spaces, as long as the child can tolerate it.Prevent transmission to othersIf it is safe and possible, open windows to get fresh air into the room where the child with COVID-19 infection is staying. Where it is not possible to separate the child and caregiver from the rest of the family, try to separate those at high risk for severe disease from the child with infection and their caregiver.  Keep things clean: Any surfaces and household items, such as dishes, cups and cutlery, touched by the child with COVID-19 infection should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day. Separate dishes and eating utensil should be used from the infected child.Encourage members of the household to clean their hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.Monitor the child with COVID-19 infection and othersThe caregiver and others in a home with a child with COVID-19 infection should pay close attention to how they feel (even if they are vaccinated or are being careful). On average, it takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected for symptoms to show. However, it can take up to 14 days.The caregiver and others in your home should pay attention for any symptoms of COVID-19: including fever, cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, muscle or body ache, diarrhoea or shortness of breath. Get tested if you have any of these symptoms. Seek immediate medical care if you have any of these severe symptoms of COVID-19: Difficulty breathingChest painConfusionLoss of speech or mobility The caregiver should pay attention and monitor COVID-19 symptoms of the child with infection regularly and seek immediate medical care if notice any of these symptoms:High feverRapid breathingLethargy or not interacting when awakeDifficulty in feeding (unable to drink or breastfeed)Blue lips or face",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers
072eaa8d-ce16-49fd-82af-442ff749fedf,Our healthcare provider has recommended that I use a pulse oximeter as part of the care I am providing at home to a COVID-19 patient. What is a pulse oximeter and what does it do?,"A pulse oximeter is a small medical device used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood. People with COVID-19 may have low oxygen levels, which can be life-threatening.To measure the level of oxygen in the blood, a pulse oximeter is usually placed on the finger or toe of the person who is sick. Using a pulse oximeter is painless and only takes a few minutes. If your healthcare provider recommends the use of a pulse oximeter, be sure to get instructions about how to use it and how to read and understand the results, and report them to your healthcare provider. Accurate measurements and readings from a pulse oximeter are important signs in determining if and when a COVID-19 patient at home may need urgent care at a healthcare facility. As a general rule, a decline below 90%, or a progressive downwards trend, can be an early warning of need for further medical assessment.Most COVID-19 patients being cared for at home will not require a pulse oximeter.

b857d2a3-afc4-43f4-8b96-a6c9d8dc08a2,How do displacement and migration affect the health of refugees and migrants?,"Migration could both improve or diminish an individual’s health status. Refugees and migrants can be vulnerable to disease because of a lack of or restricted access to health care, interrupted care or under-immunization, exposure to infections and lack of care and poor living conditions in countries of origin, transit or destination.During their journey, they may face the risk of injuries, hypothermia or burns and be exposed to conditions such as overcrowding and inadequate hygiene. In transit and host countries, they may face policies that exclude them from access to health care. Many refugees and migrants, especially undocumented migrants, live on the fringes of society and may suffer from xenophobia, dangerous work and substandard housing.  Women (as well as trans and gender diverse people who can get pregnant) may be affected by risks related to pregnancy and childbirth and lack of effective and timely sexual and reproductive health services. Exposure to gender-based and sexual violence, abuse and trafficking also represents a risk for many. There is also considerable variation in the mental health of refugees and migrants. People may suffer from mood disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Poor conditions, such as unemployment or isolation, are linked to increased rates of depression. Migration can affect children’s mental health. Refugee and asylum-seeking children may be at higher risk of experiencing mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (1). Unaccompanied children are particularly vulnerable and may have unmet needs, including mental health needs.COVID-19 has posed additional challenges including the increased risk of infection and death, the adverse economic consequences of lockdowns and other restrictions (2), and a lack of access to health services and vaccination against COVID-19.Migration itself could also improve the health of individuals by improving the conditions that increased or prolonged their illness such as dire poverty, violence or natural disasters. However, the sustained benefits of migration and the impact on their health depends on the ultimate access to migrant-sensitive health systems designed to address in a continuous form the health needs of citizens and non-citizens alike. 2.

c7e39a2c-b4c4-4fec-953d-a743e1fbad9c,Why is refugee and migrant health important?,"Global migration is a long-standing phenomenon. It may increase because of conflict, persecution, environmental degradation and climate change, and a profound lack of human security and opportunity. Many people move in the hope of improved employment and life opportunities.The correlation between health and migration is dynamic by nature and complex. Health is strongly related to the social determinants of health, including employment, income, education and housing. When not properly supported by appropriate intersectoral policies, migration can expose the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups to significant risks.Addressing the needs of these populations with well-functioning public health and health services responds to the human right to health, protects the health of both migrants and host communities, and contributes to integration and social and economic development. This is because refugees and migrants contribute to the society in which they live, especially when in good health. Access to information, prevention and appropriate care, including diagnostics, treatment and vaccines, is essential for these groups to fulfil their health needs. Furthermore, it ensures security for global public health.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/refugee-and-migrant-health
809378cc-7fc8-42c2-a798-fe70fb13470e,What are the definitions of refugee and migrant?,"The term refugee is defined in Article 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which states, ""For the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'refugee' shall apply to any person who … owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it”.There is no universally accepted definition of the term migrant (1). However, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs defines an international migrant as “any person who changes his or her country of usual residence” and this definition includes any people who are moving or have moved across an international border, regardless of legal status, duration of the stay abroad and causes for migration (2).Migrants may be given a migration status that limits their entitlement and access to essential services, including health care. However, international law guarantees universal access in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) (3).Although governed by separate legal frameworks, refugees and migrants are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms as other people (4).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/refugee-and-migrant-health

Therefore, WHO does not recommend compulsory disease screening of refugees and migrants when they arrive in a country. This can trigger anxiety in individual refugees or migrants, and in the wider community. It may deter people, especially those in an irregular situation, from asking for a medical check-up and can jeopardize the identification of high-risk patients.If screening is used, it should be associated with appropriate risk assessments serve the needs of refugees and migrants, and its effectiveness should be considered. It should be voluntary, non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing, carried out clearly for the benefit of the individual and the public, and be linked to accessing treatment, care and support. Attention should be paid to medical ethics including informed consent and confidentiality. Pre- and post-screening counselling should be offered.WHO has produced a broad range of technical guidance to assist States in carrying out assessments at borders in the context of COVID-19 while protecting human rights, including management of ill travellers at points of entry (1).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/refugee-and-migrant-health
7627b218-06e9-4f1e-b4f1-7d7df4f49c85,Should refugees and migrants be vaccinated?,"Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health investments and a key component of primary health care. Vaccines underpin global health security and are critical to the prevention and control of infectious-disease outbreaks.A systemic and tailored approach to strengthening vaccination programmes is needed, with national policies that provide equitable and high-quality immunization services tailored to specific populations, including refugees and migrants, offered free of charge.Outreach strategies should be considered to improve the delivery and uptake of vaccines. Such strategies may include interpreters and cultural mediators; information in the languages of the refugees and migrants; collaboration between health and social services networks, local service providers and refugee and migrant communities; and training and culturally relevant information for health care and other professionals so they understand the specific needs of refugees and migrants.The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a new focus and priority for the vaccination of vulnerable groups. Equitable access to vaccination, including for refugees and migrants, is of prime importance. Many countries, including those receiving large influxes of refugees and migrants, have adopted best practices and included them into their routine vaccination programmes.

This acceptance requires political commitment to tackle xenophobia, discrimination, exclusion and misinformation about these populations and their health needs.Reduction or removal of communication and language barriers is key to improving access to services by refugees and migrants. However, while a common language is crucial, culturally competent services should offer more than just minimal communication.

This normative guidance is found in its air quality guidelines like the recently updated WHO air quality guidelines: global update 2021 or the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion (documents available here). These often serve as the basis for formulating national standards and policies for air quality and energy access.WHO has a global communications campaign called BreatheLife. It is a partnership of WHO, UN Environment and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to reduce short-lived climate pollutants that aims to increase awareness and action on air pollution by governments and individuals  (see www.breathelife2030.org). WHO’s Urban Health Initiative has been providing  a model for the health sector to contribute to healthy urban planning and policies. This model has focussed on cross-sector consultations, health sector training, policy-scenario modelling, advocacy and communications (link to UHI reports ?).WHO develops training material on air pollution and health that specifically targets the health workforce, for example clinicians and community health workers.WHO develops and pilots a number of tools and resources to support countries, cities and regions address the health impacts from air pollution by engaging in multisectoral activities such as:a web-based tool, AirQ+, which estimates health impacts from varying levels of pollutant exposure; the Clean Household Energy  Solutions Toolkit (CHEST) to support the development of clean household energy policies and the implementation of the WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion, including tools for stakeholder mapping, monitoring and evaluation, and engaging the health community;  the Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) to assess walking and cycling interventions; a Carbon Reduction Benefits on Health (CaRBonH) calculation tool that allows quantification of the physical and economic consequences for human health achieved through improvements in country-level air quality from domestic carbon reductions; andthe GreenUr tool to raise importance of green space and health.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022

Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in order to not spread the dirty to areas that are less soiled. All disinfectant solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared every day.In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19.

Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas.Wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes. Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. Do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets. Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use.Do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.The minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.Note: Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings

Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage.This practice will be ineffective since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant, and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways.

This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who is infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as soon as they start speaking, coughing or sneezing they can still spread the virus.  The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In addition to health safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent this resource from being used for important interventions such as drinking water treatment and environmental disinfection of health care facilities.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings

It may settle on an individual’s skin and clothing, resulting in external exposure to radiation. Radioactive iodine deposited on skin can be removed by washing with warm water and soap.If radioactive iodine is inhaled (e.g., from a radioactive cloud) or ingested (e.g., through contaminated food, milk or water), it results in internal exposure to radiation.

During a nuclear accident, the thyroid gland is at particular risk as it does not differentiate between stable (non-radioactive) and radioactive iodine. Uptake of radioactive iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children. The younger the age at exposure, the higher the risk of developing thyroid cancer later in life. In children of Chernobyl, exposed to radioactive iodine with contaminated milk and food, the increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was first detected 4 to 5 years after the time of exposure in 1986.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies

This protective measure known as iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) consists of administering potassium iodide (KI) (1) tablets before or at the beginning of exposure to radioactive iodine. When taken at the appropriate dosage and within the correct time interval around exposure to radioactive iodine, KI saturates the thyroid gland with stable (non-radioactive) iodine. As a result, radioactive iodine will not be taken up and stored by the thyroid gland.

This gland gathers iodine to produce thyroid hormones, which are important for metabolism in all age groups. Thyroid hormones are also crucial for brain maturation and the development in the fetus and young child from the 15th week of gestation to 3 years of age. When iodine intake falls below certain levels, the thyroid is no longer able to produce hormones in sufficient amounts, which is a threat to health. In some areas where foods and diet are deficient in iodine, intake is supplemented using iodized table salt.However, iodized table salt used in day-to-day eating and cooking does not contain sufficient concentrations of iodine to block the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid. During nuclear emergencies, iodized table salt should not be used as a substitute for KI since it will not provide protection against radioactive iodine, and because eating excessive amounts of iodized salt will itself pose a significant health hazard.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies
4c4b4c5a-b743-4ca4-b32d-0881c7a206db,When and how should I take KI?,"KI should not be taken as a generic protective measure in anticipation of an event. KI tablets should be taken only when explicitly instructed to do so by public health authorities. The effectiveness of KI for thyroid blocking depends on its timely administration. The optimal period of administration of stable iodine is less than 24 hours prior to, and up to 2 hours after, the expected onset of exposure. It would still be reasonable to take KI up to 8 hours after the exposure. However, taking it later than 24 hours after exposure will offer no protection.Instructions from public health authorities about how KI must be taken should be followed carefully; the correct dose of KI will differ according to age (see the package insert for detailed dosage explanation). A single dose of KI usually offers adequate protection for 24 hours.In the event of prolonged or repeated exposure, unavoidable ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water, and where evacuation is not feasible, repeated administration of stable iodine may be necessary. Under such circumstances, neonates (< 1 month of age), pregnant or breastfeeding women, and persons older than 60 years should not be given repeated doses of KI. Other protective actions should be considered for these particular groups on a case-by-case basis and under medical advice.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies

This can mean they are pre-distributed to strategic sites such as households, schools, hospitals, pharmacies, fire and police stations, and evacuation and civil defence centres. When the implementation of iodine thyroid blocking with KI is warranted, public health authorities should define the geographic area in which the population should take KI tablets, as well as when, how and by whom. These instructions may be given through the radio, TV, internet, loudspeakers and other available channels and should be carefully followed. National authorities decide on the methods of pre-positioning and pre-distribution of KI pills in their countries.Voluntary purchase of iodine tablets by the general public is allowed in many countries; however, it should not be taken until instructed by authorities. In addition, iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) should not be implemented as stand-alone protective action but jointly with other measures such as sheltering, evacuation, and stopping the consumption of contaminated food and drinking water, if needed.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies

The risk of thyroid cancer in children following exposure to radioactive iodine is higher than in adults; younger age groups are at highest risk. As a result, the protection of children must be considered a priority when public health authorities distribute and administer KI to individuals. It should be given to all children at the recommended dosage. The only exceptions are children who have an absolute contraindication (see below on contraindications).Newborn babies (< 1 month of age) should only ever take a single dose of KI. These babies should have their thyroid hormone levels monitored after the administration of KI; a consultation with a paediatrician within the first week after the administration of KI is advisable.

The fetal thyroid gland may be exposed to radioactive iodine through the placenta, but it will also be protected by the KI taken by the mother. Like the rest of the population, pregnant women should take KI tablets only when instructed so by the authorities. By doing so, they will protect their own thyroid as well as that of their unborn child. Once the nuclear emergency is over, pregnant women should inform their doctor so this information can be added to their medical records and thyroid function of the newborn baby can be evaluated. Pregnant women should usually take only a single dose of KI.Breastfeeding women also should take KI tablets only when instructed by public health authorities. The amount of KI that a breastfeeding woman will provide to an infant through breast milk is not enough to protect the thyroid of an infant exposed to radioactive iodine. Therefore, in addition to the KI tablet taken by a woman who is breastfeeding, the baby should also be given KI at the recommended, age-specific dosage (3). Under these conditions, breastfeeding can continue. Unless otherwise instructed, breastfeeding women and newborn babies should each take only a single dose of KI.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies

When the appropriate dosage is followed, side effects from KI are rare in children and young adults. However, they may include mild allergic reactions, skin rash and gastrointestinal upset.The risk of side effects from KI increases with age, while the risk of radiation induced thyroid cancer in individuals over 40 years old is low. For this reason, thyroid blocking with KI is not generally indicated in adults over 40 years of age (with an exception for emergency response personnel). Rare adverse effects of KI on thyroid function may occur in individuals with pre-existing thyroid disorders, which are more common in older adults and the elderly than in children or young adults. Side effects are more likely in individuals who receive a dosage higher than recommended, or who receive repeated doses of KI. The frequency of these thyroid disorders varies between countries, so national authorities may adopt different approaches when determining the appropriate age groups and dosing for administration of KI.There are few clinical conditions in which the administration of KI is absolutely contraindicated.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies

Every day, people inhale and ingest radionuclides from air, food and water. Most of these radionuclides are naturally present in our environment, but a minor proportion come from human-made sources related with medical and industrial applications of radiation.Additional radioactivity may be present in food if radioactive materials are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. Either falling from the air or carried in rainwater or snow, these radioactive materials can deposit on the surface of foods like vegetables or animal feed. Over time, radionuclides may be transferred through soil into crops or animals and build up within food.

0ca9428a-1477-413f-8357-d7adfec6d11c,What are the potential health effects of consuming contaminated food?,"Consuming food contaminated with radionuclides in a nuclear or radiological emergency will increase the amount of radioactivity in the body and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The level of risk will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount of radioactivity that has been incorporated.For instance, if radioactive iodine is ingested with contaminated food or drink, or inhaled with contaminated air, it will accumulate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children. Radioactive iodine reduces its radioactivity in half (so called half-life) within 8 days and eventually stops being radioactive (decays) within few weeks. To prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid, stable iodine pills (KI pills) are used to saturate the thyroid so radioactive iodine will not accumulate (more information about iodine thyroid blocking at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550185).In contrast, radioactive isotope of caesium with half-life of 30 years will stay in the environment for many years.

Food that was dispatched or commercially packaged before the emergency would not be affected. However, some food produced in areas where radioactive materials have been deposited may be contaminated and therefore food monitoring may support a risk analysis.

20cb71d6-9d71-4cc7-a033-9056ef55093a,Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for trade?,"There are internationally agreed standards for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. The Codex Guideline Levels (GLs), published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, are provided for adult and infant foods. The GLs state, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding GL, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption.”When the GLs are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the GLs may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small contribution to the total dose, the GLs may be increased by a factor of 10.GLs for radionuclide levels in food can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995).

In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the radioactive contamination of food. For example, it is possible to:protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins;close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables;bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn;harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; andnot harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded.Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as:avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables;avoid slaughtering animals;avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); andavoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.Food that was packaged and sealed before the incident, such as tinned or plastic-wrapped, is safe for consumption.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency

The concern would be mainly limited to situations with large releases of radioactive iodine, as the risk of thyroid cancer for breastfed infants would be higher than to their mothers. Thyroid blocking by oral administration of stable iodine (together with control of food and drinking-water) is an important protective action when radioactive iodine may be released in large quantities. Children, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women are most likely to benefit from iodine thyroid blocking.

The result is temporary hearing loss or tinnitus. A person enjoying a loud concert, for example, may afterwards experience muffled hearing or a ringing or buzzing in their ears (known as tinnitus). This often improves as the sensory cells recover. However, with regular exposure to loud or prolonged noise, the sensory cells and other structures can become permanently damaged, resulting in irreversible noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus, or both. The hearing loss caused by exposure to loud sounds is called noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).Noise-induced hearing loss can be immediate (such as when exposed to a sudden burst of loud sound); however, more often the loss is gradual, permanent, and frequently goes unnoticed or ignored until the effects become more obvious. Initially, you may only have trouble hearing some high-pitched sounds like bells or birdsong.

What is safe listening?,"The term safe listening simply refers to specific listening behaviors that do not put your hearing at risk.The volume of sounds, the duration of listening, and frequency of exposure to loud sounds all have an impact on hearing. The higher the level of sound and longer the duration, the greater the risk of hearing loss. For example, you can safely listen to a sound level of 80dB for up to 40 hours a week. If the sound level is 90dB, the safe listening time reduces to four hours per week. To protect your hearing:Keep the volume down. This can be done by setting your device’s volume level to no more than 60% of maximum. If you are using an app to monitor your sound level, it is best to stay below 80dB average. Use well-fitted, and noise cancelling headphones to reduce the need to raise volume in noisy situations.In noisy places, use ear protectors such as earplugs. Always stay away from sources of sound, such as loudspeakers, noisy machinery etc.Limit time spent engaged in noisy activities. Give your ears a break frequently from loud sounds. This helps the sensory cells inside the ears to recover.Monitor sound levels. This can be done by using apps. Choose devices with built-in safe listening features that allow you to monitor your exposure. Heed the warning signs of hearing loss.

The catastrophic 1918 influenza pandemic alerted the world to the deadly threat to humankind posed by influenza. Over a decade later, researchers succeeded in isolating influenza viruses – first from pigs in 1931 and then from humans in 1933. Most of the researchers working on influenza during those early years had witnessed the devastating effects of the Spanish flu pandemic and they all agreed that such a global pandemic could arise again. In 1951, international experts recognized the need for global coordination of influenza research and identified the main objects for a WHO Expert Committee for influenza. The first meeting of this WHO Expert Committee for influenza, convened in Geneva in September 1952, marks the beginning of the WHO influenza surveillance network. Initially called Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN), the network was renamed to Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System in 2011 upon the adoption by the World Health Assembly, of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework) for the Sharing of Influenza Viruses and Access to Vaccines and Other Benefits.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq

WHO convenes technical consultations twice a year (February and September) with an advisory group of experts from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyze global influenza surveillance data generated by the GISRS to determine if current seasonal influenza vaccine composition need to be updated. This considerable task requires a range of activities including but not limited to: reviewing surveillance data, the genetic and antigenic characterization of viruses, and conducting human serology studies with influenza virus vaccines.

Some factors related to food fortification such as level of fortification; bioavailability of fortificants; and amount of fortified food consumed have a significant effect on health.The choice of vehicle for fortification requires information on the consumption pattern (or potential consumption pattern) in diverse population groups, and particularly the proportion of the food vehicle consumed that is fortifiable.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-fortification

ae3ff728-2955-4653-8a8d-ce5a94444f59,Implementing mandatory versus voluntary fortification,"Mandatory and voluntary regulation in food fortification may provide different levels of certainty over time that a particular category of food will contain a pre-determined amount of a micronutrient. The higher the level of certainty provided, the more likely fortification delivers a sustained source of fortified food for consumption by the relevant population group, and, in turn, a public health benefit.Mandatory fortification occurs when governments legally oblige food producers to fortify particular foods or categories of foods with specified micronutrients. The decision about mandatory or voluntary fortification depends on many factors including (but not limited to) the population groups affected by the deficiency, populations at risk of receiving excessive amounts of a particular micronutrient, the number of big, centralized industries producing the fortified item, the cost of the process, ongoing fortification or other nutrition programmes in the country, the fortification scenario in neighboring countries, the political implications….) Globally, mandatory regulations are most often applied to the fortification of food with micronutrients such as iodine, iron, vitamin A, and increasingly folic acid, as proof of deficiency is more widely available. Of these, the iodization of salt is probably the most widely adopted form of mandatory mass fortification.In deciding the precise form of mandatory fortification regulation, governments are responsible for ensuring that the combination of the food vehicle and the fortificants will be both efficacious and effective for the target group, yet safe for target and non-target groups alike. Food vehicles range from basic commodities, such as various types of flour, sugar and salt which are available on the retail market for use by consumers as well as ingredients of processed foods, to processed foods that are fortified at the point of manufacture/use.Voluntary fortification occurs when a food manufacturer freely chooses to fortify particular foods in response to permission given in food law, or under special circumstances, is encouraged by government to do so. Voluntary fortification is usually motivated by industry and consumers seeking to obtain possible health benefits through an increase in micronutrient intakes. Occasionally, however, government provides the driving force. However, it is important that governments exercise an appropriate degree of control over voluntary fortification through food laws or other cooperative arrangements, such as industry codes of practice. The degree of control should at least be commensurate with the inherent level of risk. Regulatory controls of this nature should also ensure the safety of fortified foods for all consumers, as well as provide opportunities for industry to produce fortified foods that offer consumers nutritional and/or other health benefits.

Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.Unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time – to meet the urgent need for these vaccines while maintaining high safety standards. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Through that process, we ascertain that they remain safe for use around the world.Read more: Safety of COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety
f0e876c2-0c3b-48ee-98ce-dcd64b8e8256,How does WHO ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective?,"The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large Phase III clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have already completed their Phase III trials and are being used globally, and many other vaccine candidates are being developed and are still in the trial phase. Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence are required by WHO for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers it for emergency use listing. An external panel of experts convened by WHO (the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), analyses the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, programmatic use and other information. SAGE then recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. In addition to reviewing data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.The WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) monitors how approved vaccines behave in the real world and to identify any signals of adverse events following immunization. GACVS is an independent group of experts providing authoritative, scientific advice to WHO on vaccine safety issues of global or regional concern.Read more: Safety of COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety

After any vaccine is introduced, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that arise are then evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS) in conjunction with the relevant national authorities. As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO is supporting the implementation of safety monitoring systems for COVID-19 vaccines in every country.Read more: How the safety of vaccines is monitored.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety

Investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place. WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, researchers, and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects.Vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to safety issues are rare. Recalls are generally associated with problems identified during the monitoring of batches of vaccines through quality control systems, stability studies and reports from the field, including cold chain issues where some vaccines have not been stored at the right conditions and so are no longer safe or effective. In this case, people who have received a vaccine from that batch may need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected. This is why vaccines are so closely monitored – to ensure that any issues with their production, storage or use can be rapidly identified and resolved.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety

This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects don’t go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice. More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

A severe allergic reaction – such as anaphylaxis – is a very rare side effect of any vaccine. If you have a history of allergic reactions, talk to your healthcare provider before you get vaccinated. They will be able to give you advice. In some cases, precautions will need to be taken for people who have known allergies to previous doses of the vaccine or known components of the vaccine. Healthcare workers administering COVID-19 vaccines should be trained to recognise and treat serious allergic reactions. This is why people being vaccinated against COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the vaccination site for a period of time following their injection, to ensure that anyone experiencing an allergic reaction can receive prompt treatment. Reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination (including allergic reactions) are closely monitored by national authorities and international bodies, including WHO for the early detection of serious side effects.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety

If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country.It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Errors related to the delivery of the vaccine can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains.The results of the investigation will then inform next steps.

This is sometimes called mixing and matching vaccines, or a heterologous vaccine schedule. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines to be a complete primary series. See the full list of COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL here. By mixing and matching vaccines, countries are able to maximise vaccine impact in the event of constrained or limited supply. People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm can also be given a third dose to help boost their immunity, once a high level of coverage of the priority groups has been achieved. SAGE has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can be used for the third dose if the original vaccine is not available.

A significant amount of data is available from both clinical trials and country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild side effects are expected after vaccination; these are a normal sign that the body is developing protection. There have been reports of very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) following the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, including infections, viruses, medicines and environmental factors. The currently available data suggests that there is also a potential relationship between these symptoms and mRNA vaccines. Research is underway to understand more.Cases have been mostly reported in younger men aged 12 – 29 (40.6 cases of myocarditis per million second doses) compared to females of the same age group (4.2 cases per million second doses)[1]. The symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis are generally mild. Fast treatment with medication and rest can help to avoid long term heart damage and death. If you experience new and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath or have a racing or pounding heartbeat within a few days of vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. The benefits of these vaccines greatly outweigh the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis by preventing deaths and hospitalisations due to COVID-19. For more information, please read the updated guidance from the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS).Click here to see an infographic on myocarditis and pericarditis.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety
36e7e0e9-7e74-4ca6-8cce-808e404b9eb8,Do the COVID-19 Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines cause blood clots?,"Globally, COVID-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Johnson &Johnson/Janssen have been used to protect millions of people. Data is available from both clinical trials and preliminary data from country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild to moderate side effects such as fever, muscle and head aches, soreness around the injection site and tiredness are expected to affect some people after vaccination. These are a normal indications that the body is developing protection. There have been reports of very rare but serious cases of blood clots accompanied by low platelet counts (known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)) occurring 3 to 30 days after vaccination with COVID-19 non-replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines (such as the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines). Read more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines. With the AstraZeneca vaccine, as of 15 July 2021, the data shows that these symptoms occur in about four to six people out of every million vaccinated (this figure varies based on age, sex and geographical location)[2}. Younger adults appear to be at higher risk than older adults. More research is underway to understand more about how people may be differently affected. With the Janssen vaccine, as of the 7 May 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed 28 reports of TTS out of a total of more than eight million people vaccinated[3]. It is possible that that there a causal link between the vaccine and these symptoms, but more data is needed. TTS is very rare; however, blood clotting is a common health problem caused by many factors. Not all clots that occur after vaccination with Astra Zeneca or the Janssen vaccine will be due to TTS. The risk of blood clots is far higher from COVID-19 itself than from either vaccine. If you experience a new, severe, persistent headache, blurred vision, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, leg swelling or unusual skin bruising and shortness of breath between three to 30 days following vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. WHO has published interim guidance for clinical case management of TTS following vaccination. The benefits of the COVID-19 Astra Zeneca and Janssen vaccines are far greater than the very small risk of TTS. As well as protecting you from severe disease and death due to COVID-19, being vaccinated can protect you against complications from ‘long COVID’, provide some protection for your close contacts and community by reducing transmission, and can reduce the risk of severe disease from some variant strains. WHO recommends that these vaccines continue to be used to protect priority groups. For more information, read the Statement of the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) on safety signals related to the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and the GACVS review of latest evidence of rare adverse blood coagulation events with AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety

Some mild to moderate side effects such as fever, muscle and head aches, soreness around the injection site and tiredness are expected to affect some people after vaccination. These are a normal indications that the body is developing protection.There have been very rare reports of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring within 42 days of vaccination with the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines (adenovirus vector vaccines). Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the nerves, causing muscle weakness, tingling and/or loss of sensation in the arms and/or legs. Most people affected recover fully. Although these cases happened after vaccination, it is not yet possible to tell whether they were related to or caused by the vaccines, or if they were coincidental. The benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 greatly outweigh any possible risk. As of the 27 June, the European Medicines Agency had received reports of 227 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the European Union following vaccination with AstraZeneca. Around 51.4 million doses of Vaxzevria (the brand of AstraZeneca produced in Europe) had been administered within the European Union by 20 June 2021. For the Janssen vaccine, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reported that 100 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome had been reported through the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the United States of America (USA) as of 30 June, with approximately 12.2 million doses of the Janssen vaccine administered. Outside of the European Union and the USA, cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have also been reported; however further investigation is needed to determine whether the rate has increased from usual levels. Guillain-Barré syndrome has many causes, such as bacterial or viral infections, surgery or vaccine administration. It can also be caused by COVID-19. In 2011, it was estimated that the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome in Europe and Northern America was 0.8 to 1.9 cases out of every 100 000 people [4]. It can affect people of all ages but is more common in adults and in males. Most people recover fully even from the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome; however, it is potentially life threatening and some people affected may need intensive care. If you experience any of the following symptoms within 42 days of vaccination, contact your healthcare provider immediately:Difficulty walking Difficulty with facial movements, including breathing, speaking, chewing or swallowing Double vision or being unable to move your eyes Difficulty with bladder or bowel controlWeakness or tingling sensations in the legs, arms and faceThe benefits of the COVID-19 Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines are far greater than the very small risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

efe5330b-66cb-4b37-bb68-f8bf8f461bf7,How does COVID-19 spread between people?,"We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways.Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission).The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission).People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is also under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why some are more transmissible.

Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:Crowded places;Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.  The risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3Cs” overlap.In health facilities where people are receiving treatment for COVID-19, there is an increased risk of infection during medical procedures called aerosol generating procedures. These can produce very small droplets that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time and spread beyond conversational distances (typically 1 meter). This is why health workers performing these procedures or in settings where these procedures are performed should take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirators.

8f4a1698-11df-44aa-a8d5-343344366c7f,What is oxygen saturation?,"Within the human body oxygen is tightly regulated to prevent hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia, or low blood oxygen saturation, is a common complication of a range of clinical conditions. Hypoxemia can lead to acute adverse effects on organs including the brain, heart and kidneys. Oxygen is essential for the treatment of hypoxaemia and should be given to the patient to improve and stabilize blood oxygen saturation levels.Therefore, oxygen saturation is a crucial component of patient care. Oxygen saturation (commonly referred as oxygen level) is a measure of how much haemoglobin is currently bound to oxygen compared to how much haemoglobin remains unbound. Red blood cells contain haemoglobin, and one molecule of haemoglobin can carry up to four molecules of oxygen. Most of the haemoglobin in blood combines with oxygen as it passes through the lungs.

This method is invasive and requires blood gas analysis machine and reagents. Therefore, it is not appropriate in all contexts. A pulse oximeter can also measure oxygen saturation. It is a non-invasive method that measures light wavelengths to determine the ratio of oxygenated haemoglobin compared to deoxygenated haemoglobin. The use of pulse oximetry is considered a standard of care in medicine. It is often referred as the fifth vital sign. Medical practitioners must know the functions and limitations of pulse oximetry. They should also have a basic knowledge of oxygen saturation.When arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation is measured by arterial blood gas analysis, it is known as SaO2, and when it is measured non-invasively by pulse oximetry it is known as SpO2 (haemoglobin oxygen pulsed saturation). SpO2 is therefore often used to define hypoxaemia.Oxygen therapy for children",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/oxygen

It is used to measure the percentage of oxygenated haemoglobin in arterial blood (SpO2). The pulse oximeter consists of a computerized unit and a sensor probe, which is attached to the patient’s finger, toe or earlobe. The pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation of haemoglobin in the blood by comparing the absorbance of light of different wavelengths across a translucent part of the body. The oximeter displays the SpO2 with an audible signal for each pulse beat, a pulse rate and, in most models, a graphical display of the blood flow past the probe (the plethysmography or pulse wave). The technology is robust and the cost quite low. Pulse oximeters can be used to both detect and monitor hypoxaemia, make more efficient use of oxygen supplies and improve patient monitoring; they are cost-effective for district hospitals.

The most common sources of oxygen are air liquefaction process, pressure swing adsorption and oxygen concentrators (see question 3). Effective oxygen delivery systems should be a universal standard of care and should be made more widely available.The methods used to deliver oxygen to the patient should be safe, simple, effective and inexpensive. They could be non-invasive (through a face mask, tent or holding tubing close to the face) or semi-invasive (insertion of prongs or catheters into the upper airway). Semi-invasive delivery methods require a low oxygen flow and are cheaper than non-invasive methods, which require high oxygen flow. Nasal prongs and nasal and nasopharyngeal catheters are the most efficient means for delivering oxygen. Nasal prongs are the preferred oxygen delivery method in most circumstances for an optimal balance between safety, efficacy and efficiency. Humidification is necessary only with methods of oxygen delivery that bypass the nose; it is generally not necessary when oxygen is delivered through a nasal catheter or nasal prongs. Humidification is essential when cold oxygen is delivered from a cylinder through a nasopharyngeal catheter or when high oxygen flows are used.Oxygen therapy for children Oxygen sources and distribution for COVID-19 treatment centres COVID-19 Clinical management: living guidance",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/oxygen

However, the panel noted that the oxygen saturation threshold of 90% to define severe COVID-19 was arbitrary and should be interpreted cautiously. For example, clinicians must use their judgment to determine whether a low oxygen saturation is a sign of severity or is normal for a given patient with chronic lung disease. Similarly, a saturation > 90–94% on room air is abnormal (in patients with normal lungs) and can be an early sign of severe disease if the patient is on a downward trend.

Patients should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the health worker to determine where their care needs can best be met.Use of pulse oximetry at home is a safe, non-invasive way to assess oxygen saturation in the blood and can support the early identification of low oxygen levels in patients with initially mild or moderate COVID-19 or silent hypoxia, when a patient does not appear to be short of breath but his or her oxygen levels are lower than expected.

Can mothers living with HIV breastfeed their children in the same way as mothers without HIV?,"WHO recommends that all mothers living with HIV should receive life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) to support their health and to ensure the wellbeing of their infants.WHO released guidelines in July 2016 advising that, in countries that have opted to promote and support breastfeeding together with ART, mothers living with HIV who are on ART and adherent to therapy should breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months, and then add complementary feeding until 12 months of age. Breastfeeding with complementary feeding may continue until 24 months of age or beyond.Previously, WHO advice was to breastfeed for 12 months but then stop breastfeeding if a nutritionally adequate and safe diet could be provided.The new guidance is based on scientific evidence that shows ART is very effective at preventing HIV transmission through breastfeeding as long as the mother is adherent to therapy. The new evidence means that mothers living with HIV and their children can benefit from the many advantages of breastfeeding – such as improved growth and development – in the same way as mothers who do not have HIV and their children.

d4d45c1c-a718-460e-9e18-fbc2d536ece5,What is lead?,"Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust. It has many uses, including in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles and energy storage, in pigments and paints, solder, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys and also in some cosmetics and traditional medicines. Lead additives have been phased out of petrol for motor vehicles (1); however, lead continues to be used in some aviation fuels (Avgas) for piston-engine aircraft. The processing, use and disposal of lead can result in environmental, food and water contamination with consequent human exposure. As lead is an element, it persists as a potential source of exposure once released into the environment.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
b6bc4623-9a68-47f3-9932-37f3b12e2aa5,What is lead poisoning?,"Lead poisoning refers to excessive human exposure to lead. Exposure can occur from inhalation of lead fumes and particles (e.g., from smelting) or from ingestion of lead-contaminated dust (for example, from decaying lead paint), water (from leaded pipes) and food (from lead-glazed or lead-soldered containers). This exposure may occur over a short period (acute poisoning) or over a prolonged period (chronic poisoning). No level of exposure to lead that is without harmful effects has so far been identified. As a consequence, some health authorities define excessive exposure as having a blood lead concentration above the reference value for the population as a whole. This reference value is usually the blood lead concentration that characterises the top 2.5% or 5% of the population, i.e., the 97.5th or 95th percentile, respectively. For example, in the USA, the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention lowered its blood lead reference value to 3.5 µg/dL for children ages 1-5 years in October 2021 (2), in France, 5 µg/dL is the 98th percentile value for children under 7 years (3). WHO recommends that for an individual with a blood lead concentration  5 µg/dL, the source(s) of lead exposure should be identified and appropriate action taken to reduce and terminate exposure (4).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
306edaa7-201b-41b5-b381-7a417ed5f79d,What are the health effects of lead exposure?,"Lead has no biological function in the body. It accumulates in the body and affects practically all organ systems. Studies to date have been unable to identify any level of exposure that has no harmful effects in children or adults (5). Lead exposure can cause chronic and debilitating health impacts in all age groups, but it is particularly harmful to young children. This is because the developing nervous system is vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead, even at levels of exposure that do not cause obvious symptoms and signs. Lead exposure in early childhood can result in reduced cognitive abilities, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and antisocial behaviour. Lead exposure can also cause anaemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs. Absorption of large amounts of lead can cause coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning can be left with permanent neurological injury such as deafness and intellectual disability. Lead can cross the placenta and has been linked to adverse birth outcomes including stillbirth, premature birth and miscarriage (6).The World Health Organization 2021 update of the Public health impact of chemicals: knowns and unknowns estimates that nearly half of the 2 million lives lost to known chemicals exposure in 2019 were due to lead exposure.  Lead exposure is estimated to accounts for 21.7 million years lost to disability and deaths (disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs) worldwide due to long-term effects on health, with 30% of the global burden of idiopathic intellectual disability, 4,6% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease and 3.0% of the global burden of chronic kidney diseases (7).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning

The estimated economic costs attributable to the neurodevelopmental impacts of childhood lead exposure amounted to 1.2% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011. Expressed in terms of loss to regional GDP, the estimated cost in Africa was 4%, in Latin America and the Caribbean 2% and in Asia 1.9% (4).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
b80ada0c-bb1c-4d17-aa6b-a97be9e46e27,What are the sources of human exposure to lead?,"Lead has many uses; therefore, there are many potential sources of exposure. Important sources include environmental contamination from the recycling of lead-acid batteries and from poorly controlled lead mining and smelting operations; the use of lead-containing traditional remedies; lead ceramic glazes used in food containers; lead pipes and other lead-containing components in water distribution systems; and lead paint. Improperly recycled electrical and electronic waste is a growing source of environmental lead contamination, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (8). Leaded gasoline used to be an important source of exposure, but all countries have now banned its use (9). The continued use of tetraethyl lead in some aviation fuels exposes populations around airfields to lead (10). Environmental contamination can lead to ingestion and inhalation of lead and its compounds. Most cases of oral lead poisoning result from small amounts of lead-containing material such as contaminated dust or soil, flakes of lead paint, contaminated food and spices, lead-containing traditional medicines or from ingestion of lead as a foreign body. Inhalation of lead as fumes or particles is a major occupational route of exposure.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
4a471f5a-1f79-40ea-af0f-bc62d59ec240,How important are used lead-acid batteries as a source of lead exposure?,"Lead-acid batteries are used in motorized vehicles, for storage of energy generated by solar panels and wind turbines and for back-up power supplies. The growth in the use of renewable energy sources and the concomitant need for storage batteries, as well as the increasing demand for motor vehicles as countries undergo economic development, mean that the demand for lead-acid batteries is increasing. Approximately 86% of the total global consumption of lead is for the production of these batteries, and over half of this demand is met through recycling (11). On average, lead-acid batteries contain 10 kilograms of lead (11).Lead, as fumes, particles and dust, can be released at all stages of the battery recycling process, from draining and dismantling the batteries to smelting and refining the lead. Environmental contamination from recycling can be extensive and can cause significant exposure to workers and to surrounding communities. People engaged in recycling who do not wash and change their clothes before leaving work can bring lead contamination home with them and expose household members. Preventing lead release requires the use of adequate engineering controls, trained staff, the provision of protective equipment and the implementation of occupational and environmental standards. In many parts of the world where lead is recycled, these measures are not available or enforced. Non-regulated, informal lead-acid battery recycling is carried out in homes, backyards and surrounding areas, and is performed with few, if any, pollution controls. It has the potential to expose a large number of people across communities or neighbourhoods. Informal, or so-called backyard, recycling is widely practised in many low and middle-income countries and has resulted in serious, and even fatal, lead poisoning and is associated with many serious health outcomes including poor cognitive development in children, cardiovascular disease and can even cause death (8,12). Children, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age are at the highest risk (13).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
5c389cf5-a9a5-4322-bca0-93c0f528186c,What is lead paint?,"In the context of action to eliminate lead paint, the term ‘paint’ includes varnishes, lacquers, stains, enamels, glazes, primers and other coatings. Paint is typically a formulated mixture of resins, pigments, fillers, solvents and other additives. Lead paint is paint to which one or more lead compounds have been added to confer specific properties such as colour or corrosion-resistance or to speed up drying. Lead compounds are primarily added to some solvent-based paints, such as enamel (gloss) paints. The lead content of paint can range from less than 90 ppm (90 mg/kg) to over 100 000 ppm (100 000 mg/kg). In paints with no added lead, there may be a small amount present as a contaminant of the raw materials used in manufacture, but when a manufacturer takes care to source uncontaminated raw materials, the lead content is usually well below 90 ppm.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
058783df-f69f-45b0-8557-051dcc5ce9cf,"How feasible is it to eliminate lead in paint, and how important are regulations to restrict the use of lead in paint?","To achieve the global goal of phasing out lead paint, every country needs to have in place legally binding control measures to stop the manufacture, sale, distribution and import of lead paint. Such measures can include statutes, regulations, and/or mandatory technical standards establishing a binding, enforceable limit on lead in paint, with penalties for non-compliance. Lead paint laws exists in 88 countries and 19 countries are in the process of finalizing drafting a legislation. Alternative, non-lead-based ingredients are available that can be used to formulate paint. Lead paint data collected around the world show that in every country where studies have been conducted, there are paint companies producing paint containing less than 90 ppm of lead. This demonstrates that eliminating lead in all paints is within the capability of local producers (14). In those countries where no regulations are in place to restrict the use of lead paint, paint intended for household use with hazardous levels of lead is typically widely available on the market.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
70c7a15b-4b0c-4eb2-8c81-2259152ae0e5,Why is lead paint an important source of human exposure?,"Lead paint is still used in 55% of countries and, since the phase-out of leaded petrol, this paint is one of the largest widespread sources of domestic exposure to lead for children. As lead painted objects start to decay, the paint often fragments into flakes and dust that contaminate the home environment. This aging process can be very fast in some climates. Paint flakes and dust are readily swallowed by young children, who typically play on the ground and frequently put their hands to their mouths. Some children compulsively pick flakes of paint off surfaces and eat them. The removal of lead paint, for example during home renovation or maintenance of painted structures such as bridges, can also result in the release of lead-contaminated dust if it is not done in a safe manner. Lead paint can remain a source of exposure for many years after its use is prohibited. Even in countries that banned lead paint decades ago, there are still many homes where lead painted surfaces can be found. The sooner that lead paint is banned in a country, the sooner this toxic legacy can be eliminated.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
54278b7a-d079-4bac-8c47-e4a5aa15d11b,What are the economic costs of removing lead paint?,"Once lead paint has been applied in the home, it becomes a potential source of lead exposure, particularly as the paint starts to age and decay. In France, while the number of children with blood lead concentrations above 10 µg/dL is now small, 74% of cases are associated with poor quality housing where there is lead paint (16). Older housing with lead paint has also been identified in the USA as a risk factor for elevated blood lead concentrations in children (17).Removing lead paint carries a cost, particularly as measures must be taken to prevent environmental contamination with lead during removal and disposal. In France, based on 2008 values, it was estimated that the cost of remediating all homes with lead paint would range from €133.1 million to €342.5 million (US$ 193.8–498.7 million at 2008 exchange rates) (16). In the USA, the costs of remediating lead-painted homes inhabited by young children were estimated to range from US$ 1.2 billion to US$ 11 billion in 2009 (17).Cost-benefit analyses have indicated that investment in lead paint abatement yields large returns. In France, the estimated net benefit was €3.8 billion (US$ 5.5 billion at 2008 exchange rates) (16). These benefits were calculated on the basis of avoided health costs for the management of lead exposure and avoided social costs, for example in relation to reduced IQ, the need for special education and lost lifetime earnings. In the USA, it has been estimated that each dollar invested in lead paint hazard control yields a return of US$ 17–221 (18).    Of course, the most cost-effective solution is to prevent the use of lead paint altogether. Eliminating the use of lead in paints does not need to be expensive and a number of manufacturers have already successfully reformulated products to avoid the intentional addition of lead (17).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning

Stakeholders include governments, intergovernmental organizations and non-State actors, including civil society, regional bodies, philanthropic organizations, academia, media and the private sector. Interested individuals may also participate as stakeholders. The broad objective of the Lead Paint Alliance is to promote the phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead and eventually to eliminate the risks that such paints pose.The Lead Paint Alliance emerged from the call by governments at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 for lead paint to be phased out. Progress on this issue was discussed at the second International Conference on Chemicals Management in 2009 (ICCM2). ICCM2 noted the success of the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles in phasing out the use of leaded gasoline and supported the establishment of a global partnership to promote the phase-out of lead paint. In 2015, the global elimination of lead paint by 2020 was re-affirmed as a global priority issue at the Fourth Session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM4). The phasing out of lead paint by 2020 is one of the priority actions for governments included in the WHO Road map to enhance health sector engagement in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management towards the 2020 goal and beyond.Learn more on the Lead Paint Alliance, including how to become a partner",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning
4545aad4-259e-4ec0-a56b-53c02d526bae,What can Member States do to eliminate lead in paint?,"There are safer alternatives to lead compounds for use as pigments and driers in paint. These have been available for several years and studies have shown that using these alternatives does not significantly increase the cost of paint (20). However, there is still a general lack of awareness on the issue of lead and an absence of mandatory standards for lead in paints in many countries. In countries where lead paint is still available, governments should introduce legally binding controls to either ban or restrict the use of lead paint. Examples of control measures include prohibiting the use of any lead compounds in paint or setting a maximum permissible limit for the lead content of paint at the lowest feasible level. Additional information on establishing legally binding control measures, including a Model law and guidance for regulating lead paint (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish), can be found on the UNEP website.  Other measures include requiring the use of paint with no added lead in public buildings such as schools and hospitals and informing the public about the hazards of lead to encourage the purchase of paint without added lead. This market pressure can encourage paint manufacturers to take voluntary action to stop adding lead compounds to their products. The phase-out of leaded gasoline has shown how successful such policy measures can be. The mean population blood lead concentration in many countries has greatly decreased as a result of the banning of leaded gasoline, together with other lead control measures. The Lead Paint Alliance is working towards the global elimination of lead paint through the adoption in all countries of legally binding laws, regulations, standards and procedures to control the production, import, sale and use of lead paints. This target gives special attention to the elimination of lead decorative paints and lead paints for other applications most likely to contribute to childhood lead exposure; however, the goal is to control lead in all paints. As of 30 June 2022, 88 countries had informed the Lead Paint Alliance secretariat that such control measures were in place. For further information on the status of legally binding controls, see the WHO Global Health Observatory database. The phasing out of lead paint is one of the priority actions for governments included in the WHO Road map to enhance health sector engagement in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management towards the 2020 goal and beyond.

You should try to become informed about sources of lead exposure in your community and avoid buying products that may contain lead. For example, check
the label when buying paint to see if lead is mentioned. If you are not sure ask the vendor or the manufacturer about possible lead content. If you know that lead paint is not legally controlled in your country, lobby your politicians to do something
about it. If you are planning to redecorate a building or to renovate painted furniture and you think the original paint may contain lead, seek expert advice about safe methods for removing the paint. When buying cosmetics and traditional medicines, take care to only buy from a regulated manufacturer, as high levels of lead have been reported in some of these products. When you buy a new car battery, take the old one back to the distributor or to a licensed recycling facility rather than dumping the battery or allowing it to be recycled at an informal or unlicensed facility. Only dispose of your electrical and electronic equipment when they break, not simply when they go out of fashion.

COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory diseases.Both viruses share similar symptoms, including cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, headache and fatigue. People may have varying levels of illness with both COVID-19 and influenza. Some may have no symptoms, mild symptoms or severe disease. Both influenza and COVID-19 can be fatal. 2. COVID-19 and influenza spread in similar ways. Both COVID-19 and influenza are spread by droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings or breathes. The droplets and aerosols can land in the eyes, nose or mouth of people who are nearby -- typically within 1 metre of the infected person, but sometimes even further away. People can also get infected with both COVID-19 and influenza by touching contaminated surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.  3. Some of the same groups have a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and influenza. While all age groups can be infected with both the COVID-19 virus and influenza virus, these people are at higher risk for severe disease and death from both COVID-19 and influenza:older adults;people of any age with chronic medical conditions (such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurologic, liver or hematologic diseases); andpeople with immunosuppressive conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, patients receiving chemotherapy or steroids, or malignancy)Healthcare workers are at high risk of getting infected by COVID-19 and at high risk of getting infected by influenza. Pregnant people and those who have recently given birth are at high risk for experiencing severe influenza and severe COVID-19.  4. The same protective measures are effective against COVID-19 and influenza. To protect against COVID-19 and influenza, follow these public health and social measures:Maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others and wear a well-fitted mask when that’s not possible;Avoid crowded and poorly ventilated places and settings;Open windows or doors to keep rooms well ventilated;Cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue and throw the tissue into a closed bin;Clean your hands frequentlyAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth;Stay home if you don’t feel well; andContact your medical provider if you have any of the following severe severe symptoms of COVID-19, including:Shortness of breath,Loss of appetite,Confusion,Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,High temperature (above 38 °C)Vaccination is an important part of preventing severe disease and death for both COVID-19 and influenza. Follow the advice of your local authorities on getting the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. WHO recommends the influenza vaccine for older individuals, young children, pregnant people, people with underlying health conditions, and health workers. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled. If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if you:Have a compromised immune systemAre pregnant or nursing your babyHave a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the ingredients in the vaccine)Are severely frailPeople with mild symptoms of both COVID-19 and influenza can usually be cared for safely at home.

1d418922-05b3-435a-9936-53ce7a071034,What are the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines?,"The updated WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) provide recommendations on air quality guideline levels as well as interim targets for six key air pollutants. They also offer qualitative statements on good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (PM), for example, black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms, for which there is insufficient quantitative evidence to derive AQG levels.Based on the extensive scientific evidence currently available, the guidelines identify the levels of air quality necessary to protect public health worldwide. The AQGs also serve as a reference for assessing if, and by how much, the exposure of a population exceeds levels at which it might cause health concerns. They cover some of the most monitored pollutants critical for health, for which evidence on health effects from exposure has advanced the most in the past 15 years. The guidelines focus on so-called classical pollutants, particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO). When action is taken to reduce these classical pollutants it also has an impact on other pollutants.Guideline levels for specified pollutants can be used as an evidence-informed reference to help decision-makers in setting legally binding standards and goals for air quality management at international, national and local levels. They are also a practical instrument with which to design effective measures to achieve pollutant emission and concentration reductions, and therefore, to protect human health.

The pollutants with the most robust evidence for public health
concern include particulate matter (PM), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO). The health risks associated with PM smaller than or equal to 2.5 microns (µm) in diameter (PM₂.₅) are of particular
public health relevance. PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and PM₂.₅ can even enter the bloodstream, primarily resulting in cardiovascular and respiratory impacts. In 2013, outdoor air pollution and PM were classified as
carcinogenic by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).Air pollution originates from numerous sources of emission, both natural and anthropogenic (resulting from human activity). The main sources of anthropogenic air pollution can vary geographically, but include the energy sector, the transport sector, domestic cooking and heating, waste dump sites, and industrial activities and agriculture. The process of combustion is the greatest contributor to air pollution, in particular the inefficient combustion of fossil fuels and biomass to generate energy. In indoor environments, the use of solid fuels and kerosene in unvented heating and cooking stoves, tobacco combustion and combustion for other purposes, such as cultural or religious practices, are important as well.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines

implementation of the project. For the AQGs, more than 500 papers were identified for systematic review and synthetized to get the most up-to-date evidence for establishing the new AQG levels.These guidelines do not include recommendations about any kind of multiple exposures. In everyday life, people are often exposed to a mixture of air pollutants at the same time. WHO acknowledges the need to develop comprehensive models to quantify the effects of multiple exposures on human health.

e6815f47-7bf2-43c1-b138-7229a99fe029,Why are the AQGs so important for protecting health?,"The burden of disease associated with both ambient and household air pollution exposure is large and growing. This is partly due to increases in exposures in low- and middle-income countries, but in part also due to the rapidly increasing prevalence of
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide as a result of population ageing and lifestyle changes. Air pollution especially increases morbidity and mortality from the noncommunicable cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that are the major causes
of global mortality; it also increases the disease burden from lower respiratory tract infections and increases preterm birth and other causes of death in children and infants, which remain a major cause of the disease burden in low- and middle-income
countries.WHO estimates show that around 7 million premature deaths, mainly from noncommunicable diseases, are attributable to the joint effects of ambient and household air pollution. Global assessments of ambient air pollution alone suggest hundreds of millions of healthy years of life lost, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries.Although air quality has improved gradually in high-income countries, pollutant concentrations still exceed the 2005 WHO AQGs for several pollutants in many areas. More than 90% of the global population in 2019 lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 WHO air quality guideline for long-term exposure to PM₂.₅. Air quality has generally deteriorated in most low- and middle-income countries, because of large-scale urbanization and economic development that has largely relied on the inefficient combustion of fossil fuels, like coal, as well as inefficient residential fuel use and industry. However, disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide, particularly as low- and middle-income countries are experiencing growing levels of air pollution.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines
6d24d273-2947-4e16-81d8-67eb9abefee1,How is the burden of poor air quality distributed globally?,"Exposure to air pollutants is heavily dependent on their ambient concentrations. For example, ambient PM₂.₅ concentrations vary substantially between and within regions of the world. Importantly, more than 90% of the global population in 2019 lived in
areas where concentrations exceed the 2005 WHO AQG level of 10 µg/m³ – and with the 2021 AQG level being lower there will subsequently be an increase in the attributable health burden in all countries. In 2019, annual population-weighted
PM₂.₅ concentrations were highest in the WHO South-East Asia Region and then in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Elevated concentrations were also observed in some western African countries, largely due to the impact of Saharan dust. Windblown desert
dust contributes to sometimes very high exposures to particles larger than 10 µm. This is a prominent issue in many arid areas in the Middle East, northern Africa, the Gobi Desert and elsewhere..Many of the countries with the lowest national PM₂.₅ exposure levels were either in the WHO Region of the Americas or the European Region. Trends in PM₂.₅ indicate a relatively stable population-weighted global mean concentration, which reflects both
decreases in exposure in the European Region, the Americas and recently in some parts of the Western Pacific Region, and increases elsewhere.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines

Whereas guidelines are not legally binding recommendations, they can be used as an evidence-informed reference tool to help decision-makers in setting
legally binding standards and goals for air quality management at international, national and local level. Academic researchers and national and local authorities working in the broad field of air pollution may also find them useful for planning
and impact assessments, and they may stimulate further research and monitoring. They can also be used as an advocacy tool for protecting public health from air pollution, for example by civil society and academic groups.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines

for PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂, O₃, SO₂ and CO, for relevant averaging times and in relation to critical health outcomes.Interim targets serve to guide reduction efforts towards the ultimate and timely achievement of the AQG levels. Meeting the interim targets may have a notable benefit for health, especially in those regions where exposures far exceed interim targets.Good practice statements help to manage certain types of particulate matter (i.e. black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and duststorms), when numerical AQG levels can not be established in the absence of clear quantitative

WHO has performed a rapid scenario analysis to assess the health gains attributable to improved annual ambient particulate matter concentrations, if the AQG levels
were achieved. Around 80% of deaths attributed to PM₂.₅ exposure in the world could be avoided if countries attain the annual AQG level for PM₂.₅. Reaching the interim targets also offers substantial benefits for health. For example, attainment
of interim target 4 for PM₂.₅ (the same level as the AQG from 2005), would result in a nearly 48% decrease in total deaths attributed to PM₂.₅ exposure. The highest impact would be observed in the South-East Asia and African regions (57% and 60%
reduction respectively).Results clearly demonstrate a major reduction in the estimated burden of disease, even if other analyses may yield different estimates due to different assumptions made. The WHO scenario analysis showed that if the interim targets were achieved, the greatest benefit in terms of reduced burden of disease would be observed in countries with high PM₂.₅ concentrations and with large populations. Results are significantly different for high-income countries, as in most cases the PM₂.₅ ambient concentrations in these areas are already below the interim targets.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines
25de3379-63cd-41d3-bc12-e72ae0435085,Is there a link between air quality and COVID-19?,"Poor air quality is an important risk factor for both acute (e.g. pneumonia) and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or stroke). People with underlying medical conditions are thought to be at a greater risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19 infection; thus, air pollution is most likely a contributing factor to the health burden caused by COVID-19.During the global COVID-19 pandemic, however, there has been an important, albeit short-term, reduction in concentrations of air pollutants across cities. This reduction was more prominent in the case of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), a pollutant very much related to traffic, which was dramatically curtailed by lockdown measures. European data for some cities has shown a reduction of around 50%, and in some cases up to 70%, in NO₂ levels compared to pre-lockdown values.COVID-19 has been a tragedy but, at the same time, the response measures have shown how policies related to transport and the way people work, study and consume, can contribute to a better air quality, something that should be taken into consideration for the post-pandemic recovery policies that many countries are already working on.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines

They persist in the atmosphere for as little as a few days or months and their reduction has co-benefits not just for health but also for the climate.Almost all efforts to improve air quality can enhance climate change mitigation, and climate change mitigation efforts can, in turn, improve air quality. Notably, reduction or phase-out of fossil and biomass fuel combustion will reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as health relevant air pollutants. By promoting environmental sustainability hand in hand with public health protection, we can make large steps towards mitigating climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-global-air-quality-guidelines

It uses your body’s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger. Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.Most vaccines are given by an injection, but some are given orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nose.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination
6d06f66c-36d1-4b66-9370-cbd76158331b,How does a vaccine work?,"Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:


Recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria.


Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease. 


Remembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.


The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.
Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination

More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare.Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it is introduced. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause health risks.Remember, you are far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine. For example, tetanus can cause extreme pain, muscle spasms (lockjaw) and blood clots, measles can cause encephalitis (an infection of the brain) and blindness.

All phases assess safety. The last phase, phase III, are usually conducted in a large number of people, often 10’s of thousands.  After that, the vaccine needs to go through a review by the national regulatory authority, who will decide if the vaccine is safe and effective enough to be put on the market, and a policy committee, who will decide how the vaccine should be used.       In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of consecutive steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the research and development process have been happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. It is the scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous.The more vaccines in development the more opportunities there are for success. Any longer-term safety assessment will be conducted through continued follow up of the clinical trial participants, as well as through specific studies and general pharmacovigilance of those being vaccinated in the roll out.  This represents standard practise for all newly authorized vaccines.More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-research-and-development

Some scientists believe that this approach could accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, in part because it would require far fewer volunteers than a typical study. However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed – particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study.

It continues to work to diversify both its portfolio of vaccines and channels for access to vaccines, Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they have been allocated proportionally  to the population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease. In phase II, vaccine will be allocated to target countries with higher threat and vulnerability.WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, vaccines can go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly.COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 and 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022. The Facility has the possibility to increase those doses by another 1 billion as right of first refusal for several candidates in clinical trials supported by CEPI. Although these doses are not enough for everyone in all countries, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic.The number of countries willing to donate vaccine has been increasing. It is important that they do so using the COVAX mechanism so the vaccine are allocated to countries that need them most. At least one billion doses could be donated by high income countries in 2021.COVAX’s need for doses is greatest right now. Countries with higher coverage rates, which are due to receive doses soon should swap their places in supply queues with COVAX so that doses can be equitably distributed as quickly as possible. COVAX continues to be in close dialogue with countries who have expressed interest in sharing doses with the Facility and expects further announcements on this to take place over the coming weeks and months.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation

WHO, UNICEF, and partners are supporting countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine introduction. The Country Readiness and Delivery workstream – which is part of the ACT Accelerator – has developed a toolbox with guidance, tools, and trainings.WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has issued interim policy recommendations for the rollout of all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use. These recommendations can guide and support country decision-making bodies, such as the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups, on the optimal use of existing COVID-19 vaccines.  WHO has also developed detailed technical guidance and adaptable planning tools and templates to help countries plan for COVID-19 vaccines considering the many aspects of readiness that need to be put in place. These areas include planning and implementation, data and monitoring, supply and logistics, and acceptance and demand. To support initial preparations, a vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool (VIRAT) has been developed and disseminated. It provides countries with an integrated roadmap of milestones and a framework for self-monitoring progress in preparing for vaccine introduction. This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are available.WHO advises every country to develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines.  Having one plan in each country, that comprehensively describes all elements of the country’s approach to COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be crucial for a coordinated effort. Guidance on developing that plan is available from WHO, including all elements that a country needs to consider.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation

What are the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates)?,"The WHO/ILO Joint Estimates are the official estimates of WHO and ILO on the burden of disease attributable to occupational risk factors.1,2 They are produced at national, regional and global level and disaggregated by sex and age group and provide the most comprehensive set of official estimates of work-related burden of disease produced to date.Until very recently, WHO and the ILO have produced separate estimates on work-related burden of disease, with the use of different methodologies yielding different results. Member States have asked that the two United Nations Specialized Agencies harmonize their estimates, and UN reform has compelled UN organizations to build synergies as One UN.In 2016, WHO and the ILO agreed to develop a joint estimation methodology and produce the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. In 2019, the two Organizations further strengthened their partnership by signing a Collaboration Agreement to produce the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates regularly. In the same year, WHO and ILO proposed to the UN Statistical Commission that an indicator be added to the SDG indicator system on mortality from diseases attributable to occupational risk factors, produced from the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.3 In 2021, the Organizations published the first set of WHO/ILO Joint Estimates, capturing 19 occupational risk factors and 31 health outcomes.1,2",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/total-who-ilo-joint-estimates-of-the-work-related-burden-of-disease-and-injury--2000-2016

How large is the work-related burden of disease?,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimate that 1.9 million people died from occupational risk factors globally in the year 2016.1,2. Of these work-related deaths, diseases accounted for 81%, while injuries comprised 19%. These are WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates).Globally in 2016, risk factors at the workplace caused the loss of 90 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). One DALYs is one year of life lost to disease, disability or premature death, summing years lived with disease or disability and those lost to premature death. Of the 90 million work-related DALYs lost, disease and injuries accounted for 71% and 30%, respectively (difference due to rounding).Loss of life and health is often referred to as “burden of disease”, the umbrella term for the combined burdens of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and injuries. The WHO/ILO Joint Estimates currently comprise selected non-communicable disease and injuries.1,2 They can be sourced from the Global Monitoring Report1 and our website with a visualizing and downloading application .",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/total-who-ilo-joint-estimates-of-the-work-related-burden-of-disease-and-injury--2000-2016

How can work-related burden of disease be prevented?,"Governments, in consultation with workers and employers, can act to prevent work-related burden of disease.4 Governments need to ensure universal coverage with occupational health services5 and people-centred primary health care to reach disadvantaged workers, such as migrants and workers in the informal economy. 6 Additionally, social protection floors can protect disadvantaged workers. Earlier in September 2021, WHO with partner agencies put forward 20 actions that decision-makers and local actors can take to protect and promote health in the workplace, as part of a larger compendium of 500 actions to create healthier populations through healthy environments.7Employers can ensure provision of occupational and workers’ health and safety risk assessments and that workers have access to occupational health services. A collection of International Labour Standards on Occupational safety and health can be found in the NORMLEX information system. 8 Through regular occupational and workers’ health and safety assessments, workers’ exposure to occupational risk factors can be monitored and relevant health screening can be used to provide early detection of occupational disease (e.g. testing for exposure to occupational risk factors or screening for work-related or occupational diseases). Workers or their representatives and employers can ensure healthy and decent working conditions through bilateral and collective bargaining agreements.For each occupational risk factor, there are also specific measures that can be taken to prevent their work-related burden of disease. For many of the physical occupational risk factors, the Hierarchy of Controls9 should be followed: ideally, risk factors should be eliminated or less hazardous substitutions used. If this is not possible, engineering controls can be introduced to isolate workers from the hazards, or administrative controls to change the way people work. Finally, if exposure cannot be reduced by other methods, workers can be protected with Personal Protective Equipment.Intersectoral action is required, at least between the health and labour sectors.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/total-who-ilo-joint-estimates-of-the-work-related-burden-of-disease-and-injury--2000-2016

What is the global Comparative Risk Assessment and how do the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates contribute to the CRA?,"The global Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) and its framework were developed by WHO with partners in the 1990s.10 It quantifies burden of disease at population level caused by various risk factors in a comparative and internally consistent way. It always applies the same definitions and framework; uses a similar method for combining exposure and risk information; and uses the same method for expressing results (often deaths and DALYs). The CRA links burden by disease and by risk factor.Our report for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates is WHO's most comprehensive CRA for occupational risk factors. It is the first joint CRA of WHO with ILO. This joint CRA comprises WHO/ILO Joint Estimates covering 19 risk factors and 31 health outcomes. It estimated attributable burden of disease, i.e. current burden from past exposure to occupational risk factors. It uses reported cases of occupational disease and injury to inform the estimates where applicable.

4916739e-35d0-4240-9d4f-3c17e53e0634,12. How have the estimates been calculated?,"To estimate the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to an occupational risk factor and health outcome pair, it is necessary to know the population attributable fraction (PAF). A PAF quantifies the proportion of deaths or DALYs lost from a particular health outcome that is attributable to a specific risk factor, e.g. the proportion of deaths from stroke that can be attributed to exposure to long working hours. Additionally, the total number of deaths and DALYs that are estimated to occur each year for the health outcome are needed, e.g. the total number of deaths and DALYs from strokes in 2016. This is referred to the “total disease envelope”.11 WHO produces these envelopes from mortality records collected by governments in countries. 12For 39 of the pairs of occupational risk factors and health outcomes included in this report the methodology for estimating burden of disease is established. For these, we were able to calculate PAFs from established burden of disease estimates for each risk factor and health outcome.13 These were applied to the total disease envelope for each year and for each disease. This resulted in estimates of the numbers of deaths and DALYs for each health outcome attributable to its respective occupational risk factor.For the estimates related to exposure to long working hours (≥ 55 hours per week) and cardiovascular diseases,14 PAFs needed to be calculated. To do this, we required two key data sources: i) the prevalence of exposure to long working hours and ii) the risk ratio for the two cardiovascular outcomes among those exposed to long working hours compared to those not exposed to long working hours. Prevalence of exposure was modelled using data on the number of hours worked from over 2300 worldwide surveys. Risk ratios for the effect of exposure to long working hours on ischaemic heart disease and stroke were sourced from systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted by WHO and ILO, supported by a large number of individual experts.15, 16 Once the PAFs were calculated, they were applied to WHO’s total disease envelopes for stroke and ischaemic heart disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/total-who-ilo-joint-estimates-of-the-work-related-burden-of-disease-and-injury--2000-2016

In the absence of certain infrastructure, such as the availability of colposcopes, large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) or of safe surgical settings, bridging strategies may be considered in carefully selected circumstances, to extend access to treatment rather than provide no treatment. For example, ablation may be an option for a carefully chosen, small type 2 transformation zone where the probe tip will achieve complete ablation of the squamocolumnar junction epithelium – that is, where it can reach the full extent, depth and upper limit of the transformation zone – and where adequate training for selection and follow-up is available.B.

The current recommendations cover interventions for some sexual and reproductive health issues - including for pregnancy and newborn care, family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual health; and for some non-communicable diseases – including heart disease and diabetes. Examples of self-care interventions include self-administered injectable contraception, self-collection of vaginal samples for HPV screening, self-monitoring of blood glucose for diabetes, including gestational diabetes; self-monitoring of blood pressure for heart disease and managing pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, or HIV and pregnancy self-tests.

The enabling environment includes all the elements, beyond health services themselves, that require attention to ensure that self-care interventions can be appropriately implemented. These include the education, justice and social services sectors, because self-care interventions are mostly accessed and/or used outside formal health services.

Some self-care actions, such as washing your hands, wearing masks, and practicing good respiratory hygiene measures that protect you from COVID-19, do not need you to meet with a health worker. Other self-care interventions, such as obtaining a prescription for hormonal contraception and abortion medications or counselling during pregnancy, will need interaction with a health worker.

It had grown 21% since 2014, just five years earlier, and is set to keep expanding[3].Only 17% of e-waste produced in 2019 reached formal management or recycling systems[3]. The rest was illegally dumped domestically or internationally, overwhelmingly in low- or middle-income countries, in unmonitored sites, where it was recycled by informal workers. Even in cities with organized waste management systems, e-waste is often discarded alongside other solid waste, ending up in landfills. Such discarded e-waste can leach toxicants into aquifers and drinking water supplies. As use of cell phones, smart phones and computers grows exponentially, rapid obsolescence sees much faster replacement cycles, and technological advances create new products containing valuable and dangerous components, such as electric cars and e-cigarettes. The global volume of e-waste is expected to balloon if nothing is done. It is expected to reach 74.7 million tonnes by 2030, while global employment in the waste sector is projected to soar by some 70%, or another 45 million jobs, many of them in e-waste processing[4].",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health

How are children and informal workers exposed to them?,"Informal e-waste workers, including children, may be exposed to over 1,000 harmful substances, including lead, cadmium, mercury, dioxins, nickel, brominated flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  These substances can pollute the air, dust, water and soil as well as volatilize from contaminated ground.Workers, their families and communities are exposed to these when reclaiming the trace amounts of valuable metals in e-waste through open burning, heating or acid leaching (using cyanide salt, nitric acid or mercury). The burning of e-waste materials to extract metals also makes e-waste sites frequent sources of intense air pollution contaminated by toxic mixes of harmful particles, including heavy metals and industrial chemicals and compounds.  E-waste workers, their families and communities are exposed to these toxic chemicals in several different ways, including through ingesting contaminated food, water, soil and dust, breathing in toxic aerosol particles and gases, and through skin exposure. Children and babies face additional risks from the body burdens of their mothers through breast milk and transplacental exposure and from direct contact with toxic chemicals from frequent hand-to-mouth behaviour.  Children as young as 5 years of age have been reported working at e-waste recycling sites and are known to frequently work alongside their parents and families in e-waste recycling activities and businesses. E-waste recycling activity can be considered as hazardous child labour as it may be detrimental to their physical and mental health and development.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health

They absorb more pollutants relative to their size and are less able to metabolize or eradicate toxic substances from their bodies, than adults.   Children breathe air closer to the ground, where some air pollutants may be at their highest concentration. Dumpsites can become a child’s favourite playground as they are full of new and exciting objects – but they can also be the only playground the children have.  As children practice more frequent hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth activity, this increases their risk of ingesting contaminants. Children also have less agency than adults and do not choose where they live or, especially when they are very young, how much time they spend indoors or at their parent’s workplaces, where toxicants may be at high concentration.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health
7e9de343-871b-402c-9a1f-63d990a2b4fa,What can be done about e-waste?,"In response to the health threats informal waste disposal poses, UN agencies and independent experts have called for stronger action on improperly recycled e-waste. This means effective and binding action by exporters, importers and governments that:ensure health and safety of e-waste workers, children, their families and communities with systems that train and protect workers, that monitor exposures and health outcomes, and that make protecting children the highest policy priority;  enforce sound environmental health practices for disposal, recapture and reuse of materials;shift towards a circular economy by manufacturing more-durable electronics and electrical equipment, using safer and less-toxic materials, and encouraging sustainable consumption to reduce e-waste — as opposed to current trend of increasing turnover;manage e-waste by prioritizing health and environmental protection throughout the life cycle, with reference to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, appropriate regional conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals on waste management; eliminate child labour and incorporate adult e-wastes workers into the formal economy with decent conditions across the value chain of collection, processing/recycling and resale by incorporating informal workers in the formal economy.  There are economic and environmental imperatives involved, too: better recycling presents opportunities for increased income and decreased demand for new materials. In 2019, up to US$57 billion in raw materials could have been recovered if e-waste had been recycled optimally3. Extracting resources from e-waste supports climate mitigation goals and produces less carbon dioxide (CO2) than mining for the same materials[5].  The health sector can provide leadership and advocacy on e-waste initiatives and contribute to multi-sectoral action by reaching out to other sectors to demand that health concerns, particularly those of children, be made central to e-waste policies. Opportunities for leadership and collaboration include: regional and national capacity-building for health-based assessment of e-waste policies and regulations, particularly regarding children’s health;raising awareness of e-waste health risks and encouraging responsible recycling with policy-makers, communities, waste workers and their families;  building health sector capacity to diagnose, monitor and prevent toxic exposures within primary health care services for children and women;pursuing better data and further research about women and children involved with e-waste, as well as studies about implementation and effectiveness of protective measures.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health

WHO does not recommend a specific rate for countries to achieve at population level. The work conducted by WHO found that as countries increase their caesarean section rates up to 10%, maternal and neonatal mortality decrease. However, caesarean section
rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates. Despite this, mortality is not the only outcome to consider. Other important outcomes would be short- and long-term maternal and perinatal morbidity,
for example, obstetric fistula, birth asphyxia, or psychosocial implications regarding the maternal¬–¬infant relationship, women’s psychological health, women’s ability to successfully initiate breastfeeding and paediatric

A caesarean section rate at population level includes, thus, all deliveries in such a geopolitical area. On the other hand, the medical and obstetric characteristics of the women attending any particular hospital are often different from those of the overall population. This results in different needs for caesarean section, and also different caesarean section rates.

8a3c6282-bb81-4032-ae4e-a2fb91ca6efd,Why are more women giving birth by caesarean section nowadays?,"In the last decades, the proportion of birth by caesarean section has increased in an unprecedented way. This is due to many reasons, which may be country- and culture-specific. Some of the most omnipresent reasons behind this rise are: the fear of pain
during birth including the pain of uterine contractions; the convenience to schedule the birth when it is most suitable for families or health care professionals; and because caesarean section can be perceived as being less traumatic for the baby.
In some cultures, caesarean section allows people to choose the date or day of the birth due to beliefs around luck or that a certain date or day is more auspicious for the child’s future.
In a number of countries, there is societal pressure for a perfect birth outcome, and health professionals may be sued when the results of a vaginal delivery are not as expected, which fuels their fear of litigation. In addition, in some societies, delivery by caesarean section is perceived to better preserve the pelvic floor, resulting in less urinary incontinence, in addition to a more satisfactory return to sexual life.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions

However, there is no evidence showing the benefits of caesarean delivery for women or infants who do not require the procedure. Although
caesarean section has become a very safe procedure in many parts of the world, it is not without risk. As with any surgery, caesarean section is associated with short- and long-term risks with potential implications in future pregnancies. These risks

3f2e34d3-1d4f-4b7b-b50a-8a09e710becc,Why is a standardized system to classify caesarean sections necessary?,"Particularly in hospitals, it is important to be able to compare caesarean section rates and outcomes in a reliable manner. For example, doctors and midwives need tools to analyze the impact of their practices, clinical protocols and changes. Historically,
we have classified caesareans according to their indications or causes (e.g. intrapartum fetal distress, dystocia, failure to progress). The challenge with these types of systems is that their results are difficult to accurately reproduce as definitions
vary and different doctors may categorize the same caesarean section under different indications. This has prevented meaningful comparisons not only between hospitals but also within hospitals over time. The Robson (also known as the “10 groups”) Classification  system overcomes
some of the inherent problems of the indications classifications. It is simple, robust, reproducible, and clinically relevant.

161e2b31-493a-460a-9014-dd9b6ce731e8,How does contact tracing work?,"Contact tracing identifies, and monitors people who have been exposed to someone who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and involves several steps: Defining contacts: Contact definitions may vary by country. WHO defines a contact as a person who has been exposed to someone else who has had recent probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1. face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for at least 15 minutes; 2. direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 3. direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without the use of recommended PPE; or 4. other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. Exposure is considered any time between 2 days before to at least 13 days after the case started to show symptoms. For asymptomatic cases, a contact is anyone who has been exposed between 2 days before and 10 days after the date on which the sample that led to confirmation of infection was taken. Identifying contacts: this is usually done through an interview with the person infected with SARS-CoV-2 to find out who they have been in contact with during the period of time described above. There are other ways to identify contacts depending on the setting, for example through membership or attendance lists of places the case visited during the period described above, or through public notices. Digital proximity tracing applications have also been developed to help identify and notify contacts through automated processes.  Informing contacts: each identified contact should be contacted to confirm whether they meet the definition of a contact. This may be done through health authorities and/or via digital tracing proximity applications. Cases may also be encouraged to inform their own contacts. Each person identified as a contact will be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected), how to undertake quarantine and for how long, and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional information should be provided on symptoms to monitor throughout the quarantine period, and what to do if a contact returns a positive test or becomes unwell. Managing and monitoring contacts: contacts should be encouraged and supported during the  quarantine period. WHO recommends that the quarantine period ends 14 days after the contact was last exposed to the person who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the duration of the quarantine period may vary between countries. Data processes and analysis: The information collected from each contact is stored in a secure database.

Ideally, a gender-balanced contact tracing team should be recruited from the community and have general literacy, strong communication skills, local language proficiency and an understanding of the local context and culture.They should be provided with adequate training to ensure efficiency, accuracy and good communication skills when implementing case and contact investigations, and integrated within the wider COVID-19 response team.Several training materials have been developed by WHO and partners and may be adapted to local needs. Many are available through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) knowledge platform, and OpenWHO. Training should include the basics of virus transmission, prevention and control measures; how to monitor signs and symptoms; and standard operating procedures for contact tracing, including interview tips and ethics of public health surveillance and quarantine. Contact tracers should also be briefed on their rights, roles and responsibilities, including for occupational safety and health.It is important for public health authorities to train the contact tracing workforce when there is no or low transmission, and anticipate ways to be able to scale the size of the trained contact tracing workforce, if transmission increases.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders

However, this workforce can be quickly overwhelmed in the context of widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Electronic tools and information technology have been used to enhance the efficiency of contact tracing processes, and are currently being used in the COVID-19 pandemic.  So far, no single digital tool addresses all the steps required to monitor end-to-end contact tracing and quarantine of contacts. Oversight from public health workforce is still required. The technical and ethical requirements related to the use of such digital tools should be considered  when making decisions as to the use of these tools. Digital tools that support contact tracing processes may be broadly divided into three categories based on their public health function during specific steps of the contact tracing process:Identifying and notifying contacts: These solutions are intended for use by the general public, health professionals and the contact tracing team. They include digital proximity tracing tools that use systems based on Bluetooth or GPS location signaling, to notify users who have been in close proximity and prolonged contact to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and registered their status in the tool. There are also location-based digital contract tracing tools that use quick response (QR) codes that can be scanned by smartphones users when they visit a venue, so that if they later test positive for COVID-19, other application users who attended the same venue, at the same time may be sent an alert, if local public health authorities deem it necessary.Monitoring contacts: These tools are intended for use by those identified as contacts, health professionals and the contact tracing team.  They include symptoms checker tools that can help contacts  to self-monitor and report the presence or absence of symptoms to health professionals who may conduct further assessments, health counselling and connect them with the public health authorities for testing and other supportive services. These tools may be particularly helpful in settings where contact tracing workforce personnel may be limited and/or there are physical or security barriers preventing in-person visits by contact tracing teams.Surveillance data management and analysis:  These solutions are used by public health professionals to collect, manage, analyse and visualize data collected by contact tracing teams which link cases and contacts. They include outbreak response tools (such as Go.Data, Commcare, SORMAS, etc.) that can be used for case investigation, listing and monitoring of contacts, and analysis. It is important to note that these tools cannot substitute a well-trained health and community workforce, qualified supervisors, decentralized operations and good coordination; which are all necessary criteria for successful and effective contract tracing.

In particular:Safeguards must be in place to guarantee privacy and data protection in accordance with the legal frameworks of the countries where systems are implemented.Everyone involved in contact tracing must adhere to the ethical principles of handling personal information, to ensure responsible data management and respect for privacy throughout the process.How data will be handled, stored, and used needs to be communicated to those concerned in a clear and transparent manner. This is important for buy-in and engagement as well as to avoid misperceptions that could jeopardize the effectiveness of a contact tracing programme.Digital tools used for contact tracing should be assessed before use to ensure safeguarding data protection according to national regulations.See WHO’s interim guidance on ethical considerations to guide the use of digital proximity tracking technologies for COVID-19 contact tracing.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders

What should I do if I am?,"If you think you may be a contact of someone who has recently been infected, you should be contacted by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition. You may also be informed directly by someone you were in contact with who later tested positive. If you have downloaded a COVID-19 proximity tracing application, you may also get notified through your mobile phone.        If you are identified as a contact, you should undertake quarantine, which means that you separate yourself from others in your household, stay there and monitor your health for any signs of illness. Some countries have set up dedicated facilities to enable contacts to complete quarantine outside their household. Contact your local health authorities to find out how you can safely quarantine. WHO recommends that you stay in quarantine for 14 days after you were last in contact with the person infected with the COVID-19 virus, but the duration of quarantine may vary by country.

There is a consensus by several data protection authorities that storing data on users’ phones enhances privacy, since users have greater control over the amount of information that they share with health authorities. The collection and use of such data by health authorities can therefore be limited to what is strictly necessary for the operation of a digital tracing system.Whichever approach is selected, governments and third parties should ensure digital tracing systems follow WHO guidance on ethical considerations on the use of digital proximity tracing for COVID-19 contact tracing.

You should remain separated from others in the household for the duration of quarantine. If you cannot be in a separate room, stay at least one metre away from others, the farther the better. Make sure you have enough foodand water, and a way to communicate with others. The quarantine space should be well ventilated. You should minimize your contact with others. If you do have someone visit you during quarantine, you should both wear medical masks, keep windows open if possible and clean your hands before and after being together. Ideally, you should have only one visitor provide food and supplies during the quarantine period and this should be someone at low risk of developing severe COVID-19.Quarantinemay cause worry or anxiety, and this is normal. Thiscan also be an opportunity to take time to care for yourself. Consider reconnecting with loved ones via telephone or phone apps, watch movies or read books, exercise indoors, make crafts, or catch up on things you haven’t had time for.  To help you get groceries, medicine and other necessities, ask family and friends or use delivery services.  To learn more about taking care of yourself during quarantine, watch this video:",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing

ENDS are often used as complements to cigarette smoking and not as substitutes, especially in smoke-free environments. In the USA, almost 70% of adult ENDS users also currently smoke cigarettes, while the percentage of dual users among young people is lower, at 33%.  Thus, dual use of ENDS and cigarettes sustains nicotine dependence.In combination with tobacco smoking, which is the practice among the majority of e-cigarette users, the health impacts are compounded subjecting the user to increased risk of a variety of diseases.E-cigarettes are particularly dangerous when used by children and adolescents.

They are often upheld and reproduced in the values, legislation, education systems, religion, media and other institutions of the society in which they exist. When individuals or groups do not “fit” established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion – all of which adversely affect health. Gender is also hierarchical and often reflects unequal relations of power, producing inequalities that intersect with other social and economic inequalities. [1] World Health Organization. (‎2011)‎. Gender mainstreaming for health managers: a practical approach. Geneva : World Health Organisation.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/gender-and-health

The two terms are distinct and should not be used interchangeably. It can be helpful to think of sex as a biological characteristic and gender as a social construct. Sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals. Sex is mainly associated with physical and physiological features including chromosomes, gene expression, hormone level and function, and reproductive and sexual anatomy.Sex is often categorized as females and males, but there are variations of sex characteristics called intersex. The term ‘intersex’ is used as an umbrella term for individuals born with natural variations in biological or physiological characteristics (including sexual anatomy, reproductive organs and/or chromosomal patterns) that do not fit traditional definitions of male or female[1]. Infants are generally assigned the sex of male or female at birth based on the appearance of their external anatomy/genitalia.[1] UN High Commissioner for Refugees. (2021).

Gender expression refers to how an individual expresses their gender identity, including dress and speech[1]. Gender expression is not always indicative of gender identity. ‘Transgender’ is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity and expression does not conform to the norms and expectations traditionally associated with the sex assigned to them at birth; it includes people who are transsexual, transgender or otherwise gender non-conforming[2].Sexual orientation refers to a person’s physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction (or lack thereof) towards other people[3].  It encompasses hetero-, homo- and bisexuality and a wide range of other expressions of sexual orientation[4].

8ee29858-9659-48da-87a7-cd6c0586c139,How do sex and gender influence health?,"Sex and gender interact in complex ways to affect health outcomes. Sex can affect disease risk, progression and outcomes through genetic (e.g. function of X and Y chromosomes), cellular and physiological, including hormonal, pathways. These pathways can produce differences in susceptibility to disease, progression of disease, treatment and health outcomes, and are likely to vary over the life-course.  For example, data shows that men experience more severe COVID-19 outcomes in terms of hospitalizations and deaths than women.  This is, in part, explained by higher quantities of angiotensin-converting enzyme found in men, which binds to the SARS-COV2 virus.  Gender norms, socialization, roles, differentials in power relations and in access to and control over resources contribute to differences in vulnerabilities and susceptibilities to illness, how illness is experienced, health behaviours (including health-seeking), access to and uptake of health services, treatment responses and health outcomes. For example, gender can determine health risks faced and taken. Data show that men’s increased risk of acquiring SARS-COV2, is also linked to their lower rates of handwashing, higher rates of smoking and alcohol misuse and, related to that – higher comorbidities for severe COVID-19 symptoms as compared to women.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/gender-and-health

Gender can influence a person’s experiences of crises and emergency situations, their exposure to diseases and their access to healthcare, water, hygiene and sanitation.Gender inequality disproportionately affects women and girls. In most societies, they have lower status and have less control over decision-making about their bodies, in their intimate relationships, families and communities, exposing them to violence, coercion and harmful practices. Women and girls face high risks of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, cervical cancer, malnutrition and depression, amongst others. Gender inequality also poses barriers for women and girls to access health information and critical services, including restrictions on mobility, lack of decision-making autonomy, limited access to finances, lower literacy rates and discriminatory attitudes of healthcare providers.Gender diverse people are more likely to experience violence and coercion, stigma and discrimination, including from health workers. Data suggests that transgender individuals experience high levels of mental health illness – linked to the discrimination and stigma they face from societies and in healthcare settings[1].[1] Blondeel, Karel, de Vasconcelos, Sofia, García-Moreno, Claudia, Stephenson, Rob, Temmerman, Marleen. et al. (‎2018)‎. Violence motivated by perception of sexual orientation and gender identity: a systematic review. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 96 (‎1)‎, 29 - 41L. World Health Organization.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/gender-and-health

These factors include sex, gender, race, ethnicity, age, class, socioeconomic status, religion, language, geographical location, disability status, migration status, gender identity and sexual orientation. For example, indigenous women have worse maternal health outcomes than non-indigenous women and are less likely to benefit from health care services in Latin America and the Caribbean. Therefore, inequities in maternal health between different ethnic groups should be monitored to identify critical, modifiable, health system and community factors that could limit health care coverage, including language, religion, territory and place of residence. Monitoring health inequities is essential for designing more effective programmes and policies to reduce health risks among indigenous women[2].[1] Manandhar, Mary, Hawkes, Sarah, Buse, Kent, Nosrati, Elias & Magar, Veronica. (‎2018)‎. Gender, health and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 96 (‎9)‎, 644 - 653. World Health Organization. [2] Paulino, Nancy Armenta, Vázquez, María Sandín & Bolúmar, Francisco. (‎2019)‎. Indigenous language and inequitable maternal health care, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 97 (‎1)‎, 59 - 67. World Health Organization.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/gender-and-health

For example, notions of masculinity encourage boys and men to smoke, take sexual and other health risks, misuse alcohol and not seek help or health care. Such gender norms also contribute to boys and men perpetrating violence against women and girls. They also contribute to violence perpetrated against men including homicide, youth and gang violence, which are among leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young men. Harmful masculinities also have grave implications for men’s mental health.  Societal expectations and norms around “manhood” lead men to engage in risk-taking behaviors; for example, being encouraged to have multiple sexual partners. In addition to affecting men’s health, this also leads to negative outcomes for women and children due to increased interpersonal violence, the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. Men’s lack of participation in domestic and care work adds to the high burden of unpaid care work often performed by women[1]. [1] Pan American Health Organization. (2019).

It is a strategy for making the concerns and experiences of diverse women and men an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all spheres so that they benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. Gender mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a strategy, an approach and a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Gender analysis identifies, assesses and informs actions to address inequality and inequity[1]. It is used to systematically identify differentials between groups of women and men, whether related to sex or gender, in terms of risk factors, exposures and manifestations of ill-health, severity and frequency of diseases, health seeking behaviours, access to care and experiences in health care settings, as well as outcomes and impact of ill-health.

These WHO/ILO joint estimates provide the basis for this. Governments, employers and workers can take the following actions to protect workers’ health:   Governments, in consultation with employers and workers, can introduce, implement and enforce laws, regulations and policies that ban mandatory overtime and ensure maximum limits on working time.Bipartite or collective bargaining agreements between employers’ and workers’ associations can arrange working time to be more flexible, while at the same time ensuring that maximum limits are not crossed.A heathy and green recovery from the labour consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could include a sharing of working hours between workers to ensure that numbers of hours worked do not climb above 55 or more per week, to prevent increased risk and burden of cardiovascular disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-regional-and-national-burdens-of-ischemic-heart-disease-and-stroke-attributable-to-exposure-to-long-working-hours-for-194-countries-2000-2016
5843a775-f9a1-4f85-8377-82478a8998a2,How exactly does working long hours cause stroke and heart disease?,"Evidence suggests that working long hours can cause mortality and morbidity from heart disease and stroke through two main “pathways”. The first is through physiological responses to psychosocial stress: working long hours continually activates the autonomic nervous system, immune system and, in turn, associated stress responses, with excessive release of stress hormones (e.g. adrenalin, noradrenalin and cortisol). This triggers reactions in the cardiovascular system (e.g., those that results in low heart rate variability and/or sustained high blood pressure) and lesions that cause a change in tissue (e.g., leading to the formation of fatty deposits in the arteries in coronary vessels).  The second pathway is through health-harming behavioural responses to stress, which include tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and, in turn, impaired sleep and poor recovery, all established risk factors for ischemic heart disease and stroke.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-regional-and-national-burdens-of-ischemic-heart-disease-and-stroke-attributable-to-exposure-to-long-working-hours-for-194-countries-2000-2016

There has been a huge increase in teleworking. A 2017 Eurofound and ILO report highlighted the complex association between teleworking and working hours.1 While partial and occasional forms of teleworking seemed to provide the best balance in terms of benefits and drawbacks, many workers have been teleworking for most of their working week. Teleworking can lead to longer working hours and work intensification. The National Bureau of Economic Research carried out research on 3.1 million workers in North America, Europe and the Middle East in 2020, before and after government-backed lockdowns, and found the average workday increased in length by 48.5 minutes (8.2%) during lockdowns.2 In a different report, looking at the consequences of the recession in the late 2000s, they noted productivity increased despite a decline in the workforce – the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that one reason for this is that companies could be getting the same output from fewer workers.Further to this, the future of work may also increase workers’ exposure to long working hours. The number of people working in the gig and platform economies has been increasing – a trend that started even before the Covid-19 pandemic. The impact of the expansion of the gig and platform economies is difficult to predict. The possibility of gig work could offer flexibility for workers over their working hours, however, according to an ILO report from 2018,4 work-time autonomy depends on the availability of work. Additionally, many workers use gig work to supplement their income. Further, the distinction between paid and unpaid work can be blurred for gig workers.  A 2020 paper that collected information from a small number of gig workers in Indonesia found the average working day was 12 hours.5 They suggested that “platform work can be seen as the latest way for firms to evade employment regulation”, but that more research and evidence is needed.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/global-regional-and-national-burdens-of-ischemic-heart-disease-and-stroke-attributable-to-exposure-to-long-working-hours-for-194-countries-2000-2016

People may not fully appreciate their risk of TB and treatment programmes that rely completely on people presenting for TB care when they feel sick will miss many opportunities to treat people earlier in their disease. In this way screening can help promote health, and help people bypass many of the barriers that they face in accessing health care.Screening can benefit the entire community by reducing the prevalence of TB and averting future disease.

However, implementing screening requires extra resources, both human and financial. There will also be additional costs due to increased demand for diagnostic testing of people who screen positive for TB, and for treating the extra people with TB who may be identified by screening.Resource mobilization from domestic and/or external sources may thus be needed. Funding agencies such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and other donors can support screening activities.Early and complete detection and treatment of people with TB also prevents transmission and could lead to a reduced prevalence, and by doing so it can ultimately save costs.

‘Antibodies’ are part of the body’s immune response to infection. Antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – are usually detectable in the first few weeks after infection. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or no symptoms.
‘Seroprevalence studies’ are conducted to measure the extent of infection, as measured by antibody levels, in a population under study.

WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease. Read the Director-General’s 12 October media briefing speech for more detail. Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as ‘antibodies’, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick.

04f77027-314e-4832-b5d4-2c1bf0cfbae7,What is WHO’s position on ‘herd immunity’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?,"Attempts to reach ‘herd immunity’ through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death.
The vast majority of people in most countries remain susceptible to this virus. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that in most countries, less than 10% of the population have been infected with COVID-19.
We are still learning about immunity to COVID-19. Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we don’t know how strong or lasting that immune response is, or how it differs for different people. There have also been reports of people infected with COVID-19 for a second time.         
Until we better understand COVID-19 immunity, it will not be possible to know how much of a population is immune and how long that immunity last for, let alone make future predictions. These challenges should preclude any plans that try to increase immunity within a population by allowing people to get infected.
Although older people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of severe disease and death, they are not the only ones at risk.
Finally, while most infected people get mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and some experience no disease, many become seriously ill and must be admitted into hospital. We are only beginning to understand the long-term health impacts among people who have had COVID-19, including what is being described as ‘Long COVID.’ WHO is working with clinicians and patient groups to better understand the long term effects of COVID-19.

c845d2ae-6b55-4ca7-8408-715c658d1e24,What do we know about immunity from COVID-19?,"Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks after infection.
Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (‘asymptomatic’), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response.
Globally, data from seroprevalence studies suggests that less 10% of those studied have been infected, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s population remains susceptible to this virus.
For other coronaviruses – such as the common cold, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – immunity declines over time, as is the case with other diseases. While people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus develop antibodies and immunity, we do not yet know how long it lasts.

435f6aea-2cc1-44b0-93db-33e61753dd38,What is WHO’s position on ‘lockdowns’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?,"Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people.
However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence.
WHO recognizes that at certain points, some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures, to buy time.
Governments must make the most of the extra time granted by ‘lockdown’ measures by doing all they can to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower and enable populations to drive the societal response and more.
WHO is hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed, based on the local situation.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19
af8b99e4-10ed-482a-a36f-24a4be5740e6,What does it mean to say a virus mutates or changes?,"When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit. These changes are called “mutations.” A virus with one or several new mutations is  referred to as a “variant” of the original virus. The more viruses circulate, the more they may change. These changes can occasionally result in a virus variant that is better adapted to its environment compared to the original virus. This process of changing and selection of successful variants is called “virus evolution.”Some mutations can lead to changes in a virus’s characteristics, such as altered transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease).Some viruses change quickly and others more slowly. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, tends to change more slowly than others such as HIV or influenza viruses. This could in part be explained by the virus’s internal “proofreading mechanism” which can correct “mistakes” when it makes copies of itself. Scientists continue to study this mechanism to better understand how it works.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/sars-cov-2-evolution

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. So far hundreds of variations of this virus have been identified worldwide. WHO and partners have been following them closely since January 2020. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect the virus’s properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease). WHO and its international network of experts, are monitoring changes to the virus so that if significant  mutations are identified, WHO can report any modifications to interventions needed by countries and individuals to prevent the spread of that variant.  The current strategies and measures recommended by WHO continue to work against virus variants identified since the start of the pandemic. See WHO’s Disease Outbreak News for reports on variants.

This global collaboration allows scientists to better track the virus and how it is changing.WHO’s global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory network includes a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group, which aims to detect new mutations quickly and assess their possible impact.WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible and share sequence data internationally to help one another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/sars-cov-2-evolution

Several animals like mink, dogs, domestic cats, lions, tigers and raccoon dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after contact with infected humans.There have been reports of large animal outbreaks in mink farms in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 can change while infecting minks. It has been observed that these mink variants are able to transmit back into humans through close contact with the mink. Preliminary results suggest that the mink variants infecting humans appear to have the same properties as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Further research is needed to better understand whether these mink variants will cause sustained transmission among humans and could have a negative impact on countermeasures, such as vaccines.  See WHO’s Disease Outbreak News on Denmark ( 3 December 2020)WHO works closely with other organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organisation for Animal Health, to evaluate situations of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and transmission occurring between animals and humans.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/sars-cov-2-evolution

Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill. The virus is spread from person to person through liquid particles such as aerosols (smaller) and droplets (larger) from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from an adolescent infected with the virus.  Therefore, it is important to stay at least 1 meter away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Further resources:Read our  Q&A on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): How is it transmitted? for more information on how COVID-19 spreads between people",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth

Should I be concerned?","WHO recommends that countries continue routine immunization services wherever feasible. For example, school-based vaccination initiatives should continue only if infection prevention and control measures are implemented to avoid increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus among the students, school personnel and health care providers. However, vaccines provided to adolescents have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer. It is most important that you receive the second dose at some point in time to be fully protected.Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

fed9bfc5-9fc1-4447-b77e-75299afcba62,COVID-19 makes me really anxious. I feel worried and at times have difficulty coping with stress. What should I do?,"In situations like a pandemic it is very normal to feel anxious and powerless, and that is ok. Here are a few suggestions on things that could help you proactively manage your anxiety:TIP 1: DO THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BODY AND MINDYour body and mind are connected. Here are some things you can do to keep them healthy:• Stay active! Being physically active is good for your body and can help your mind feel better too. If you can go outside, try a walk, run, bike ride, or any other sport. If indoors, try dancing, stretching, or any other movement you can do. Find what works for you – and do it! • Eat well! Try to make healthy choices about what you eat if you can.• Take notice of yourself and the world around you. This means becoming more aware of your breathing, your body and your surroundings. Try to BE PRESENT in the moment! • Sleep! Try to get the right balance of sleep each night. This will help you grow well, stay healthy, and keep clear thoughts.•  Find things that make you happy and do those things more! Listening to music, reading, playing games, chatting with friends, growing plants, cooking, drawing, playing sports…there are many possibilities! Perhaps even try something new! Just make sure that during these activities you respect physical distancing and other protection measures that are in place in your country.TIP 2: STAY CONNECTED TO LOVED ONESKeep in touch with your family and friends however you can. Use social media, email, phone calls, write a letter! Be creative. And if you can’t connect, then think about a memory of a shared time together.TIP 3: RECOGNISE HOW YOU ARE FEELINGUnderstanding how you feel is important. Don’t ignore it. Sometimes writing your feelings down can help you to describe it. It might sound easy or simple, but try this “I feel ....... right now”.TIP 4: BE KIND TO YOURSELF It is okay to feel however it is that you’re feeling. Putting pressure on yourself to always ‘be happy’ or ‘stay positive’ or ‘stay productive’ can sometimes make you feel worse. Instead, if you notice you are experiencing difficult emotions, try telling yourself: “I feel worried and scared, but that does not mean I am not coping.” “It’s been a tough time, it’s okay to be upset.” “I am feeling [insert how you are feeling] and that is okay.” “These are difficult times, it’s normal to feel upset.” Or think of something to tell yourself that works for you. TIP 5: LISTEN TO YOUR BODYOur body experiences and reacts to how we feel. Do you often get headaches? Do your shoulders, chest, or stomach sometimes feel tense? Try closing your eyes, and listening to your own breathing. Notice how you feel in each part of your body, starting from your head down to your toes. Notice if you are feeling any tightness, pain, or pressure in your body. Being aware of where you are feeling tension can help you release it.TIP 6: TRY USING YOUR BREATH TO CALM YOURSELFSlow breathing is one of the quickest ways of calming down the body when we experience feelings such as fear, worry or anger. Close your eyes and think of a calm place.

Many schools have put in place accelerated learning modalities to help pupils catch up on learning loss.  If your school is still closed, and you cannot attend classes in person, follow the procedures that your school has put in place to give you access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television). If you have access to the internet, you can also consult your teachers and other trusted adults to identify and access reliable online learning opportunities and resources, including those included in the distance learning solutions recommended by UNESCO, the United Nations agency that helps countries improve their education systems. In addition, UNESCO is collecting stories from students, teachers and parents about how they are coping and continuing to learn during school closures. Access those stories, they might inspire you. You can also contact UNESCO and share your story!

However, remember to maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene.Regarding wearing masks in schools and other public places, WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of the virus and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, WHO and UNICEF advise decision makers to apply the following criteria for use of masks in schools (either in classes, corridors or communal areas) when developing national policies:• Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.• For children between six and 11 years of age, the decision to use a mask will vary from place to place, and will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of transmission in the area where the child lives, local norms that influence social interactions, the child’s capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision, and other factors. • Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults.Watch our ‘How to wear a fabric mask’ video for a demonstration. Watch our ‘WHO’s recommended fabric mask materials and composition’ video for more information.Further resources:Read our Q&A on children and masks related to COVID-19 for more information on precautions for younger age groups.Watch our animation on medical and fabric masks, explaining who wears what, when and where.Read more in our guidance  Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19 what are the considerations in schools for wearing masks",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth

Should I be worried about this?","COVID-19 has abruptly pushed many people’s daily lives online, and you may be spending even more hours online than before. While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore, it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like going for a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches, and attention problems. If you experience these symptoms, seek help from your parents or a trusted adult. Further resources:Read our brief on Addictive behaviours: Gaming disorder  Find out more about COVID-19 and its implications for protecting children online",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth

What are my risks and how I can protect myself online.,"Since you might be spending even more time online than before, it is wise to be aware of some of the risks. First, be careful what content you share online. Risky behaviour, such as sexting or sharing of sexualized content, can expose you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams wear appropriate clothing and avoid using private instant messaging services in your communication with teachers. In addition, it’s important to note that some adolescents – for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online contact is never okay. If in doubt, or if you feel uncomfortable or distressed about some interactions you have online, tell a parent or another trusted adult immediately.Further resources:Find out more about COVID-19 and its implications for protecting children online",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth

I don’t feel safe at home. What should I do?","This is a difficult time. Many people – including perhaps your parents - are worrying about security, health, and money. When people are in cramped and confined living conditions, these tensions and stress can become even greater. It is normal to have disagreements. However, if the disagreements become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action. If you are worried about what is happening in your home, or don’t feel safe, talk to a trusted adult about what worries you, and seek their advice. During an argument or a fight, try not to draw attention to yourself so that you don’t end up getting hurt. It might be useful to have a safety plan in case the violence escalates. This includes preparing a bag with essential items, like clothing, documents and electric charger, and having a neighbour, friend, relative, or shelter identified to go to should you need to leave the house immediately for safety reasons. Arrange with the trusted adult to help you alert the relevant authorities who can help you stay safe, including the police, emergency health services and social services.In many of the countries that have been most affected by COVID-19, essential services are still available, including shelters or protection services. If there are no trusted adults for you to share your concerns with, your country may have helplines, including text services so that you can communicate with someone who can help you or give you advice.Further resources:Read more in the  COVID-19 and Ending Violence Against Women and Girls briefFind out more how COVID-19 can exacerbate risks of violence for womenin this brief COVID-19 and violence against womenRead our Guidelines for the health sector response to child maltreatment",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth

It can feel difficult to get the attention you deserve and get your work noticed, especially if this is a new job and you do not yet know your manager and other colleagues well.  If you have a comfortable relationship with your supervisor it may be helpful to discuss whether adjustments to your workload, work schedule or other work-related matters can be made.

Most new or emerging infectious diseases —whether in wildlife, domestic animals, plants or people — are driven by human activities that lead to environmental degradation. Human pressures, from deforestation, to intensive and polluting agricultural practices, to unsafe management and consumption of wildlife, increase the risk of new or emerging infectious diseases. This is why the number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks has increased steadily since 1980.   To prevent the disastrous effects of emerging infectious diseases, we have to recognize that human health is intimately connected to the health of animals and our shared environment, and take action.

6fde1db2-cd38-45f9-a39e-17d2196b13b9,What is dual-use research of concern?,"Dual-use research of concern (DURC) describes research that is intended to provide a clear benefit, but which could easily be misapplied to do harm. It usually refers to work in the life sciences, but the principles are also applicable to other fields including engineering and information technology. It encompasses everything from information to specific products that have the potential to create negative consequences for health and safety, agriculture, the environment or national security. The possibility that research might be misused, either intentionally or accidentally, is a long-standing concern of science. It can have implications in ethics and wider societal issues, and involves not only research communities and public health, but also donors, scientific publishing and public communication.One example is research into viruses and other pathogens. Scientists often create modified versions of dangerous viruses in laboratories to study how they behave in humans and animals, and ultimately how to fight them. While this is a necessary step in biological research, the modified viruses also pose safety concerns and have the potential to cause great harm if not controlled correctly or used to intentionally infect people or animals.Another example is pharmaceutical research and development. Scientists researching asthma have developed aerosol methods that help deliver drugs deeper into the lungs. While this research may hold great benefits for people with asthma and other respiratory issues, they could also be used to increase the damage of biological weapons such as anthrax.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/what-is-dual-use-research-of-concern
79812a83-736d-4c8e-831a-3b174da4d1e1,People with disability” vs “persons with disabilities,"The word “people” is normally used when referring to a collective group and is more commonly used in public health. Its use is specifically important as through its work as a public health agency, WHO aims to raise the profile of disability
from a public health perspective and not restrict it to a ‘minority’ group.
The use of “disability” rather than “disabilities” is important as it brings the notion that disability is a universal human experience and a matter of degree not an intrinsic characteristic of the individual, such as gender
or age, to categorise and count individuals. It is for this reason that the ICF is called the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.
The term ‘disabilities’ evokes associations to specific health conditions and impairments, and not an approach that is universal and agnostic to a person’s health condition. From WHO’s perspective that is an important
distinction.
Persons with disabilities as defined in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities refers exclusively to persons with long-term impairments. WHO’s mandate, however, includes anyone experiencing disability independent of the
duration.
Hence, WHO only uses the term ‘persons with disabilities’ in the context of the convention. In WHO documents, we use people with disability.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/people-with-disability-vs-persons-with-disabilities

ec9cf46a-2ef3-4ebd-b649-9a903e4223e3,Why is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities important?,"There are around 1 billion people with disability in the world. They are often the poorest of the poor. The stigma and discrimination they suffer are common in all societies. People with disability are often denied chances to work, attend school and participate fully in society - which creates barriers for their prosperity and well-being. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is important because it is a tool for ensuring that people with disability have access to the same rights and opportunities as everybody else.
The Convention is a human rights treaty designed by representatives of the international community - including people with disability, government officials, representatives of nongovernmental organizations and others - to change the way people with disability are viewed and treated in their societies.
The Convention challenges people worldwide to understand disability as a human rights issue. The Convention covers many areas where obstacles can arise, such as physical access to buildings, roads and transportation, and access to information through written and electronic communications. The Convention also aims to reduce stigma and discrimination, which are often reasons why people with disability are excluded from education, employment and health and other services.
For the first time, a legally binding international instrument now exists to guarantee that States that have ratified the treaty will promote and protect the rights of people with disability. These States will next work on passing their own national civil rights legislation to improve the lives of people with disability.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/why-is-the-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-important

This would include, for example, how they are treated by other people or whether they are able to access buildings, transportation and information. The ICF also helps ensure that disability is seen as something dynamic, based on an individual’s situation, which can change if and when the environment becomes more enabling.In the ICF, how much disability a person experiences in daily life can be very different: on a continuum it ranges from people who do not experience disability at all to people who have very severe levels of disability. Because the environment plays an important role in a person’s experience of disability, it is not appropriate to assume that certain health conditions or impairments cause more disability than others. For example, it is not appropriate to assume that people with mobility impairments experience higher levels of disability than people with hearing impairments. Nor is it appropriate to assume that two people with the exact same impairment (such as low vision) or health condition (such as Parkinson’s disease) will experience the same barriers and consequently the same level of disability. It all depends on where people live, how they are treated, what supports they have, and what level of health or social services they have access to, for example.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/model-disability-survey

Affiliation to a health insurance scheme or entitlement to a public health system is not sufficient to ensure that households are financially protected against the cost of healthcare. International experience shows that people may be legally entitled to a public health system but still not able to obtain health services without making substantial payments. Similarly, there is large variation in what constitutes “health insurance” from country to country, with very different implications on out-of-pocket expenditure.

These data rely on the same routine household expenditure surveys that are used to monitor SDG 1.1 on poverty. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other the purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. Thus, monitoring financial protection with this indicator does not add any additional data collection burden. Data needed for financial protection exists in all countries. The frequency of such data varies across countries. On average, this ranges from an annual basis to 3 to 5 years. Availability of data to produce global estimates may not necessarily align with availability of data at national or regional levels. This can improve through increased collaboration between statistical offices, ministries of health, WHO and, the World Bank and other partners. Financial protection indicators are easy to compute, requiring information on total, food and health expenditures from routine surveys implemented by national statistical offices.

d627d36e-fe00-42f8-8970-a838f36b1e9e,What are different ways to measure catastrophic health expenditures?,"Catastrophic health expenditures can be measured in different ways. Within the SDG monitoring framework, the so-called ‘budget share’ approach is adopted, i.e. out-of-pocket health expenditures are defined as catastrophic when they exceed a given percentage (for example, 10% or 25%) of income or consumption (household’s budget). When this happens, some families might need to choose between health and other essentials like food, and education. WHO monitoring framework includes other indicators of catastrophic expenditures, in addition to indicator 3.8.2. With these other indicators, out-of-pocket health expenditures are defined as catastrophic when they exceed a given percentage of capacity to pay, i.e. income or consumption less a deduction for necessities, rather than to total income or consumption. The argument is that everyone needs to spend at least some minimum amount on basic needs such as food and housing, and these absorb a larger share of a poor household’s consumption or income than that of a rich household. There are different approaches to deducting expenditures for basic needs. In many WHO regions expenditures for basic needs are defined as a standard amount which represents basic spending on food (see Box 2 in the Global Monitoring Report 2019). In the WHO European Region an amount representing spending on three basic needs (food, housing (rent) and utilities) is considered (see more here).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tracking-universal-health-coverage

Genomics is affected by this global health imbalance
and is currently experiencing a substantial divide that is impeding the

inequalities in the availability, quality and use of genetic
technologies, genomic research as well as provision of genomic services
are widening due to a multitude of reasons. These include a lack of financial resources, lack of health services and
infrastructure or simply the presence of more compelling health
priorities as in the case of infectious diseases like TB and HIV/AIDS. Genome related technologies can contribute to improving global
health equity. To do so, the genomic health divide must be kept in check
and ultimately bridged through equitable economic investment, clinical
research, and provision and use of genomic services and technologies
globally. The exchange of existing information, expertise and

UTN numbers may be issued for previously registered trials.In order to avoid duplication of records and permit accurate record bridging on the ICTRP, it is strongly suggested that only the coordinating centre apply for the UTN. Once the UTN has been assigned, the coordinating centre should update all records within primary registers and on all other documentation (e.g., ethical review committee submissions, letters, etc) to reflect the UTN.Remember a trial, no matter how many sites should have only one UTN.Circumstances where retrospective UTN applications may be considered are:proposal, registered (not yet enrolling)trial registered and enrolment terminatedtrial registered, still enrolling, no new sitestrial registered, still enrolling, adding a new siteAs the primary purpose of the UTN is to identify a trial through stages of a clinical trial (including registration, approvals, trial recruitment, and participant follow up), the utility of a UTN following trial completion and/or publication is currently limited.

Alternatives include alcohol-based handrub formulation to be locked in wall dispensers. These are the strategies commonly employed in facilities where small children are being cared for. It is important to ensure that placement of the handrubs is targeted at the points of care.

91d3d307-b668-4b36-9399-2b93264bd5f7,What can be done to minimize fire risks?,"The control of fire risks requires a co-ordinated approach by fire officers, fire safety advisors, risk managers, health & safety, and infection control professionals, and involves the risk assessment of points of use and storage, as well as general
safety requirements. Risk assessments should be carried out on the use of alcohol handrubs, the location of dispensers, the storage of stock and the disposal of used containers/dispensers and expired stock, giving consideration to the risks of fire.Allow the handrub to dry: Staff should be advised to let their hands dry and the vapours disperse after using alcohol handrub, which minimises these risks. The How to Handrub posters state clearly: ""once dry, your hands are safe"".StorageIn order to avoid running out of handrub, ward areas and clinical units may hold reserve stock locally. Local and central (bulk) storage must comply with fire regulations regarding the type of cabinet and store, respectively. Production and storage facilities should ideally be air-conditioned or cool rooms.No open flames or smoking should be permitted in these areas.The WHO–recommended formulation handrub should not be produced in quantities exceeding 50 L locally, or in central pharmacies lacking specialized air conditioning and ventilation.Since undiluted ethanol is highly flammable and may ignite at temperatures as low as 10oC, production facilities should directly dilute it to the concentrations outlined in the Guide.The flash points of ethanol 80% (v/v) and isopropyl alcohol 75% (v/v) are 17.5°C and 19°C, respectively.National safety guidelines and local legal requirements must be adhered to, in regard to the storage of ingredients and the final product.Care should be taken when carrying personal containers/dispensers to avoid spillage onto clothing, bedding, or curtains, and in pockets, bags or vehicles.Containers / dispensers should be stored in a cool place, and care should be taken regarding the securing of tops / lids. The quantity of handrub kept in a ward or department should be as small as is reasonably practicable for day-to-day purposes. A designated ‘Highly Flammables’ store will be required for situations where it is necessary to store more than 50 L (e.g. central bulk storage). Containers and dispenser cartridges containing handrub should be stored in a cool place away from sources of ignition. This also applies to used containers that have not been rinsed with water. Disposal issuesUsed containers and dispensers will contain gel residues and flammable vapours.Rinsing out used containers with large quantities of cold water will reduce the risk of fire and the containers may then be recycled or disposed of in general waste. Location of dispensersHandrub dispensers should not be placed above or close to potential sources of ignition, such as light switches and electrical outlets, or next to oxygen or other medical gas outlets, due to the increased risk of vapours igniting. Handrub dispensers should not be sited in any corridor that forms part of a means of escape (i.e. outside the ward). Fire Safety Advisors may need to be consulted. If dispensers are placed in a circulation area within a ward (e.g. outside bedded areas)
it is recommended that they are at least 1.2 metres apart, the circulation area is at least 2 metres wide and the maximum container size is 1 litre. The siting of handrub dispensers above carpets is not recommended due to the risk of damage and lifting/warping of carpets. Consideration should be given to the risks associated with spillage onto floor coverings, including the risk of pedestrian slips. This advice is based on a Fire Modelling Analysis Report prepared for the American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) in the US in 2003. Regions should check with local regulatory agencies for specific guidelines.Patients and visitorsClear instructions for use should be displayed at handrub dispenser points intended for use by visitors to clinical areas. These should include warnings not to use excessive amounts, and not to smoke immediately after use. SpillagesSignificant spillages should be dealt with immediately by removing all sources of ignition, ventilating the area and diluting with water (to at least ten times the volume).The fluid should then be absorbed by an inert material such as dry sand (not a combustible material such as sawdust) which should then be disposed of in a chemical waste container. Vapours should be dispersed by ventilating the room (or vehicle) and the contaminated item should be put in a plastic bag until it can be washed and/or dried safely. N.B.

The most commonly encountered POPs are organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, industrial chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) as well as unintentional by-products of many industrial processes, especially polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF), commonly known as dioxins.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)

Many products used in our daily lives may contain POPs, which have been added to improve product characteristics, such as flame retardants or surfactants. As a result, POPs can be found virtually everywhere on our planet in measurable concentrations.POPs bio-magnify throughout the food chain and bio-accumulate in organisms. The highest concentrations of POPs are thus found in organisms at the top of the food chain. Consequently, background levels of POPs can be found in the human body.Human exposure - for some compounds and scenarios, even to low levels of POPs - can lead to many health effects including increased cancer risk, reproductive disorders, alteration of the immune system, neurobehavioural impairment, endocrine disruption, genotoxicity and increased birth defects.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)
7de1212d-f4af-44e8-ba59-55e45792f33c,Are POPs found in breastmilk?,"Through its GEMS/Food Programme, WHO has collected and evaluated information
on levels of persistent organic pollutants in foods, including breastmilk,
since 1976. Over the period 1987-2003, it has coordinated three international
studies of breastmilk to assess the levels and trends of polychlorinated
dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated
biphenyls. Analysis of breastmilk, maternal blood and adipose tissue are all
relevant matrices for assessment of body burdens for persistent organic
pollutants. However, breastmilk is recognized as the preferred matrix because
has several important advantages. Biomonitoring of breastmilk data can provide
information on the exposure of the mother as well as the infants. Furthermore,
such information provides guidance on the need for measures to reduce levels of
this substances in food, which is the main source of exposures for most people.
More recently, it has been recognized that breastmilk is an ideal matrix to
generally monitor levels of persistent organic pollutants in the environment. In 2004, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was
ratified by governments to decrease environmental and human exposure to twelve
priority substances in this class. The revised WHO guidelines for developing a
national protocol describe the basic study design that can be used to monitor
human exposure over time in order to, among other things, see if the Stockholm
agreement is actually effective in reducing the release of these chemicals into
the environment. These guidelines continue to support the monitoring of
persistent organic contaminants for human health and food-chain contamination
purposes. The protocol was designed based on the advice of experts in the field
(see ad hoc WHO Breastmilk Survey Advisory Group) and on extensive experience
of certain countries in undertaking similar surveys using human samples,
including breastmilk. In order to promote reliability and comparability,
participating countries are encouraged to adhere as closely to this protocol as
possible. Ethical issues, including informed consent of donors and
confidentiality, are major considerations in this protocol. Given that
breastfeeding reduces child mortality and has health benefits that extend into
adulthood, every effort has been made to protect, promote and support
breastfeeding in the context of these studies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)

substances analysed in the study show a significantly higher level of
contamination in farmed than in wild salmon.This study is the largest conducted so far, in particular relating to the
direct comparison between farmed and wild salmon. The results reported
specifically for dioxins and PCBs are well within the range of previous
studies. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are important substances that can
affect human health. They are persistent environmental pollutants that enrich
via the food chain. Dioxins and PCBs are associated with industrial discharges,
including discharges into the sea, and ocean fish have varying levels of these
substances often directly related to the proximity of their habitat to
discharge areas. The level in farmed fish normally reflects the contamination
level of the feed used, which has been also shown in above mentioned study by

compounds on several occasions. Most recently in June 2001, the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) examined new evidence on the
toxicity of these chemicals and established a Provisional Tolerable Monthly
Intake (PTMI) of 70 picograms of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. When evaluating
standard diets in different parts of the world the results indicated that the
estimated intakes of these chemicals approach or exceed this PTMI. Based on the
mean contamination levels reported in above study, eating one or two portions
per week of farmed salmon would result in a monthly intake below this level.

0479ea3e-f6ca-4fca-bbda-7f5f6dd44400,What is being done to prevent POPs contamination?,"To address the risks associated with these substances, several steps have
been taken to reduce or eliminate emissions of dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and
other related persistent organic pollutants. Many countries have now
implemented the Stockholm Convention on POPs (2001), which suggests ending
commercial use of 12 POPs and reduce or eliminate their emission into the
environment. To monitor reduction in human exposure WHO and UNEP run a
monitoring program for POPs in breastmilk. A steady decline in levels has been
observed since 1980 for most countries.In regard to food contamination, the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission,
which is a risk management body comprised of 169 member countries, is
developing a draft code of practice for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food,
which identifies source-directed measures to reduce their presence in food,
including fish, as well as a position paper, which provides an evaluation of
the need for possible regulatory measures, such as limits in food and feed.The results of this new study in salmon and other studies should be used to
maintain the focus on reducing the exposure of humans to dioxins and
dioxin-like PCBs. Specifically, efforts to reduce the level of such substances
in animals used for human consumption should be actively supported, in
particular source-directed measures such as reduction of contamination levels
in animal feed.FAO and WHO consider fish to be an important component of a nutritious diet,
and that the risk of consuming contaminated fish must be weighted in view of
the beneficial nutritive effects of fish. FAO and WHO plan to develop general
guidance for such risk-benefit considerations, with the contamination of fish
as case studies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)
bb405fde-09a9-470f-ad63-ce2fcec256b9,What are toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and similar compounds?,"Dioxins occur as a complex mixture in the environment and in food. More than
90% of human exposure is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and
shellfish. In order to assess the potential health risk of the whole mixture, the
concept of toxic equivalence has been applied to this group of structurally and
biologically related contaminants. TCDD, the most toxic member of the family,
is used as reference compound, and all other dioxins are assigned a toxic
potency relative to TCDD, based on experimental studies. These international
TEFs have been developed for application in risk assessment and management, and
have been adopted formally for regulatory purposes by a number of countries and
regional bodies, including Canada, the European Union, Japan and the United
States of America.During the last 15 years, WHO, through the International Programme on
Chemical Safety (IPCS), has established and regularly re-evaluated toxic
equivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and related compounds through expert
consultations. WHO-TEF values have been established in 1998 which apply to
humans, mammals, birds and fish. The last consultation was held in 2005 to
update human and mammalian TEFs. Details on the process and outcome can be

aa1c427b-6e8d-4d91-9e47-0f3e6b51ae0c,What is a dose of radiation and how is it measured?,"Only the energy from ionizing radiation that is imparted to (or absorbed by) the human body can cause harm to health. To understand its biological effects, we must know (or estimate) how much energy is deposited per unit mass of the part of our body with which the radiation is interacting.The international (SI) unit of measure for an absorbed dose is the gray (Gy), which is defined as 1 joule of energy deposited in 1 kilogram of mass. The old unit of measure for this is the rad, which stands for radiation absorbed dose. One gray is equal to 100 rads.The biological effect of this radiation depends not only on the amount of the absorbed dose but also on the intensity of the ionization in the living cells caused by different types of radiation. This is known as the equivalent dose. For example, neutron, proton and alpha radiation can cause 5-20 times more harm than the same amount of the absorbed dose of beta or gamma radiation.The unit of equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv). The old unit of measure is the rem. One sievert is equal to 100 rems.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ionizing-radiation

This includes a person’s ability to:meet their basic needs;learn, grow and make decisions;be mobile;build and maintain relationships; andcontribute to society.Functional ability consists of the intrinsic capacity of the individual, relevant environmental characteristics and the interaction between them. Intrinsic capacity comprises all the mental and physical capacities that a person can draw on and includes their ability to walk, think, see, hear and remember. The level of intrinsic capacity is influenced by several factors such as the presence of diseases, injuries and age-related changes. Environments include the home, community and broader society, and all the factors within them such as the built environment, people and their relationships, attitudes and values, health and social policies, the systems that support them and the services that they implement.

Stress occurs in a wide range of work circumstances but is often made worse when employees feel they have little support from supervisors and colleagues, as well as little control over work processes. There is often confusion between pressure or challenge and stress, and sometimes this is used to excuse bad management practice.Pressure at the workplace is unavoidable due to the demands of the contemporary work environment. Pressure perceived as acceptable by an individual may even keep workers alert, motivated, able to work and learn, depending on the available resources and personal characteristics. However, when that pressure becomes excessive or otherwise unmanageable it leads to stress. Stress can damage an employees' health and the business performance.Work-related stress can be caused by poor work organization (the way we design jobs and work systems, and the way we manage them), by poor work design (for example, lack of control over work processes), poor management, unsatisfactory working conditions and lack of support from colleagues and supervisors.Research findings show that the most stressful type of work is that which values excessive demands and pressures that are not matched to workers’ knowledge and abilities, where there is little opportunity to exercise any choice or control, and where there is little support from others.Workers are less likely to experience work-related stress when demands and pressures of work are matched to their knowledge and abilities, control can be exercised over their work and the way they do it, support is received from supervisors and colleagues, and participation in decisions that concern their jobs is provided.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/ccupational-health-stress-at-the-workplace

The BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity, as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered as a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same body fat percentage in different individuals. It is difficult to develop one simple index for the measurement of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents because their bodies undergo a number of physiological changes as they grow.

It is not uncommon to find under-nutrition and obesity existing side by side within the same country, the same community or even within the same household in these settings.

f98ff6f0-0f3c-4037-8ce5-1c4cdf4cb782,What are the causes of childhood overweight and obesity?,"The fundamental cause of childhood overweight and obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. 
Global increases in childhood overweight and obesity are attributable to several factors. First, there has been a global shift in diet towards increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat and sugars but low in vitamins, minerals and other healthy micronutrients. There is also a trend towards decreased physical activity levels due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of recreation time, changing modes of transportation and increasing urbanization. 
WHO recognizes that the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity results from changes in society. Childhood obesity is mainly associated with unhealthy eating and low levels of physical activity, but the problem is linked not only to children's behaviour but also, increasingly, to social and economic development and policies in the areas of agriculture, transport, urban planning, the environment, food processing, distribution and marketing, as well as education.
The problem is societal and therefore it demands a population-based multisectoral, multidisciplinary and culturally relevant approach.
Unlike most adults, children and adolescents cannot choose the environment in which they live or the food they eat. They also have a limited ability to understand the long-term consequences of their behaviour.

It is recognized that prevention is the most feasible option for curbing the childhood obesity epidemic since current treatment practices are largely aimed at bringing the problem under control rather than effecting a cure. The goal in fighting the childhood obesity epidemic is to achieve an energy balance which can be maintained throughout the individual's life span. 
WHO recommends the following to reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity:

increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts;
limit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats; 
limit the intake of sugars; and

Improved socioeconomic conditions have undoubtedly had an indirect impact on disease. Better nutrition, not to mention the development of antibiotics and other treatments, have increased survival rates among the sick; less crowded living conditions have reduced disease transmission; and lower birth rates have decreased the number of susceptible household contacts. However, looking at the actual incidence of disease over the years can leave little doubt of the significant direct impact vaccines have had, even in modern times.
For example, since sanitation is not better now than it was in 1990, it is hard to attribute the virtual disappearance of diseases such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in children in recent years in countries with routine Hib vaccination (from an estimated 20 000 cases a year to 1419 cases in 1993, and dropping, in the United States of America) to anything other than the vaccine.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions

Smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people and was one of the most feared diseases for over 3000 years. Today is completely gone thanks to immunization efforts.
Another example is measles. There have been periodic peaks and valleys throughout the years, but the real, permanent drop in measles incidence coincided with the licensure and wide use of measles vaccine beginning in 1963. Other vaccine-preventable diseases show a roughly similar pattern in incidence, with all except hepatitis B showing a significant drop in cases corresponding with the advent of vaccine use.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions

Does that mean the vaccine didn’t work?,"The incidence of hepatitis B has not dropped as much because infants vaccinated in routine programs will not be at high risk of disease until they are at least teenagers. Therefore, a 15-year lag can be expected between the start of routine infant vaccination and a significant drop in disease incidence. The Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine had a similar period of delay. Hib disease was prevalent until the early- to mid-1990s, when conjugate vaccines that can be used for infants were finally developed. The polysaccharide vaccine previously available could not be used for infants, in whom most cases of the disease were occurring.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions
4a83c92f-4fba-4f96-beec-7001377e3b8a,What happens if countries don’t immunize against diseases?,"We can look at the experiences of several developed countries after they allowed their immunization levels to drop. Three countries – the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sweden and Japan – cut back the use of pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine because of fear about the vaccine. The effect was dramatic and immediate. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a drop in pertussis vaccination in 1974 was followed by an epidemic of more than 100 000 cases of pertussis and 36 deaths by 1978. In Japan at around the same time, a drop in vaccination rates from 70% to 20–40% led to a jump in pertussis from 393 cases and no deaths in 1974 to 13 000 cases and 41 deaths in 1979. In Sweden, the annual incidence rate of pertussis per 100 000 children of 0–6 years of age increased from 700 cases in 1981 to 3200 in 1985.
There were also major epidemics of diphtheria that occurred in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, where low primary immunization rates for children and the lack of booster vaccinations for adults resulted in an increase from 839 cases in 1989 to nearly 50 000 cases and 1700 deaths in 1994. There were at least 20 imported cases in Europe and two cases in U.S. citizens who had worked in the former Soviet Union. 
It seems clear from these experiences that not only would diseases not be disappearing without vaccines, but if we were to stop vaccinating, they would come back.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions
5b969428-4f94-406c-b33b-0f10a373df6f,Can vaccines cause the disease? I’ve heard that the majority of people who get disease have been vaccinated.,"This is another argument frequently found in anti-vaccine literature, the implication being that this proves that vaccines are not effective. In fact it is true that in an outbreak those who have been vaccinated often outnumber those who have not — even with vaccines such as measles, which we know to be about 98% effective when used as recommended.
This apparent paradox is explained by two factors. First, no vaccine is 100% effective. To make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed or weakened (attenuated). For reasons related to the individual, not all vaccinated persons develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. Second, in most high-income countries, the people who have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not.
How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:
Consider a high school of 1,000 students where none has ever had measles. All but 5 of the students have had 2 doses of measles vaccine, and so are fully immunized. The entire student body is exposed to measles, and every susceptible student becomes infected. The 5 unvaccinated students will be infected, of course. But of the 995 who have been vaccinated, we would expect several not to respond to the vaccine. The efficacy rate for 2 doses of measles vaccine can be as high as >99%. In this class, 7 students do not respond, and they, too, become infected. Therefore 7 of 12, or about 58%, of the cases occur in students who have been fully vaccinated.
As you can see, this doesn't prove the vaccine didn't work — only that most of the children in the class had been vaccinated, so those who were vaccinated and did not respond outnumbered those who had not been vaccinated. Looking at it another way, 100% of the children who had not been vaccinated got measles, compared with less than 1% of those who had been vaccinated. Measles vaccine protected most of the class; if nobody in the class had been vaccinated, there would probably have been 1,000 cases of measles.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions

Could there be long term effects we don’t know about yet?","Vaccines are very safe, despite implications to the contrary in many anti-vaccine publications. Most vaccine adverse events are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking paracetamol after vaccination. More serious adverse events occur rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses), and some are so rare that risk cannot be accurately assessed. So few deaths can plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically. Each death reported to ministries of health is thoroughly examined to assess whether it is really related to administration of vaccine, and if so, what exactly is the cause. When, after careful investigation, an event is felt to be a genuine vaccine-related event, it is most frequently found to be a programmatic error, not related to vaccine manufacture.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions
e5e364b4-0c4e-4d2d-b882-85ebbb928c59,Is it true that there is a link between the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)?,"One myth that won't seem to go away is that the DTP vaccine causes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This belief came about because a moderate proportion of children who die of SIDS have recently been vaccinated with DTP; on the surface, this seems to point toward a causal connection. This logic is faulty, however; you might as well say that eating bread causes car crashes, since most drivers who crash their cars could probably be shown to have eaten bread within the past 24 hours.
If you consider that most SIDS deaths occur during the age range when three shots of DTP are given, you would expect DTP shots to precede a fair number of SIDS deaths simply by chance. In fact, when a number of well-controlled studies were conducted during the 1980s, the investigators found, nearly unanimously, that the number of SIDS deaths temporally associated with DTP vaccination was within the range expected to occur by chance. In other words, the SIDS deaths would have occurred even if no vaccinations had been given. 
In fact, in several of the studies, children who had recently received a DTP shot were less likely to get SIDS. The Institute of Medicine reported, ""all controlled studies that have compared immunized versus non-immunized children have found either no association . . . or a decreased risk . . . of SIDS among immunized children,"" and concluded, ""the evidence does not indicate a causal relation between [DTP] vaccine and SIDS.""",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions
740575ec-7a62-49ef-b158-91a533ac6d9f,Isn’t even a small risk too much to justify vaccination?,"Looking at risk alone is not enough; you must always look at both risks and benefits. Even one serious adverse effect in a million doses of vaccine cannot be justified if there is no benefit from the vaccination. However, if there were no vaccines, there would be many more cases of disease, and along with them, more serious side effects and more deaths. For example, according to an analysis of the benefit and risk of DTP immunization, if there was no immunization program in the United States, pertussis cases could increase 71-fold and deaths due to pertussis could increase 4-fold. Comparing the risk from disease with the risk from the vaccines can give us an idea of the benefits we get from vaccinating our children.
The fact is that a child is far more likely to be seriously injured by one of these diseases than by any vaccine. While any serious injury or death caused by vaccines is too many, it is also clear that the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the slight risk, and that many, many more injuries and deaths would occur without vaccinations. In fact, to have a medical intervention as effective as vaccination in preventing disease and not use it would be unconscionable.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions
55fa9bf3-1903-4659-b3dd-a4f5e7e761a9,Vaccine-preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from my country. Why should I still vaccinate my child?,"It is true that vaccination has enabled us to reduce most vaccine-preventable diseases to very low levels in many countries. However, some of them are still quite prevalent – even epidemic – in other parts of the world. Travellers can unknowingly bring these diseases into any country, and if the community were not protected by vaccinations, these diseases could quickly spread throughout the population, causing epidemics there.
At the same time, the relatively few cases that a country may currently have could very quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases without the protection given by vaccines. We should therefore still be vaccinated. There are two main reasons. The first is to protect ourselves. Even if we think our chances of getting any of these diseases are small, the diseases still exist and can still infect anyone who is not protected.
The second is to protect those around us. There is a small number of people who cannot be vaccinated (because of severe allergies to vaccine components, for example), and a small percentage of people don't respond to vaccines. These people are susceptible to disease, and their only hope of protection is that people around them are immune and cannot pass disease on to them. A successful vaccination program, like a successful society, depends on the cooperation of every individual to ensure the good of all. We would think it irresponsible of a driver to ignore all traffic regulations on the presumption that other drivers will watch out for them. In the same way, we shouldn't rely on people around us to stop the spread of disease; we must all do what we can.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions
0b279841-bb5c-4f0e-80ca-dc6a2a2bb1f2,Is it true that giving a child multiple vaccinations for different diseases at the same time increases the risk of harmful side effects and can overload the immune system?,"Children are exposed to many foreign antigens every day. Eating food introduces new bacteria into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the mouth and nose, exposing the immune system to still more antigens. An upper respiratory viral infection exposes a child to 4–10 antigens, and a case of strep throat to 25–50. According to ""Adverse events Associated with childhood vaccines"", a 1994 report from the Institute of Medicine in the United States, ""In the face of these normal events, it seems unlikely that the number of separate antigens contained in childhood vaccines . . . would represent an appreciable added burden on the immune system that would be immuno-suppressive.""
Indeed, available scientific data show that simultaneous vaccination with multiple vaccines has no adverse effect on the normal childhood immune system. A number of studies and reviews have been conducted to examine the effects of giving various combinations of vaccines simultaneously. These studies have shown that the recommended vaccines are as effective in combination as they are individually, and that such combinations carry no greater risk for adverse side effects.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions

This method provides all the advantages of the individual vaccines but will require fewer injections. There are two practical factors in favour of merging vaccines and giving a child several vaccinations during the same visit. First, we want to immunize children as early as possible to give them protection during the vulnerable early months of their lives. This generally means giving inactivated vaccines beginning at 2 months and live vaccines at 12 months. The various vaccine doses thus tend to fall due at the same time. Second, combining several vaccinations will mean fewer clinic visits for vaccinations, which saves parents both time and money and may be less traumatic for the child. In countries where there is a likelihood of reduced contact with the health care system, there is an added advantage of ensuring that there are no missed opportunities to complete the recommended vaccinations for a child.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions

Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touches surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks.Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff: Schools should enforce the policy of “staying home if unwell”, waive the requirement for a doctor’s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival.Protection of individuals at high-risk: Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and se of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.Communication with parents and students: Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes: Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support.Physical distancing outside classrooms: Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible.Physical distancing inside classrooms:In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.In areas with cluster-transmission of COVID-19, a risk-based approach should be taken when deciding whether to keep a distance of at least 1 metre between students. Staff should always keep at least 1 metre apart from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.In areas with sporadic cases/no cases of COVID-19, children under the age of 12 should not be required to keep physical distance at all times. Where feasible, children aged 12 and over should keep at least 1 metre apart from each other.  Staff should always keep at least 1 metre from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.  Remote learning: Where children cannot attend classes in person, support should be given to ensure students have continued access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television), (e.g. delivering assignments or broadcasting lessons). Shutting down educational facilities   should only be considered when no alternatives are available.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools

Yet this varies between regions and income groups.Most countries maintain a census or population registry and 86% conducted a census in the last 10 years, providing important baseline data for many health estimates. However, only half of the countries provided disaggregated population projections, limiting the use of these data.High-quality data are not routinely collected in sufficient detail to allow effective assessment of health trends and health inequalities at various levels.The divide between high and low-income countries is reflected in many key areas, including the counting of births, deaths and causes of death.     Nearly 40% (4 in 10) of the world’s deaths remain unregistered. The current COVID-19 pandemic has brought this into focus, whereby countries face serious challenges in both measuring the full burden of the virus as well as accurately counting deaths.  Optimizing health service data is critical to ensure equitable, quality services for all. Yet nearly 50% of countries have limited or less capacity for systematic monitoring of quality of care. The report illustrates the high availability of data on immunization, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS although less coverage of mental health and cancer. For instance, only 48% of countries report national facility data on severe mental health disorders. Data coverage is usually better at national and subnational levels, but less so when disaggregated by sex and age. Approximately 60% of 133 countries have a well-developed or sustainable system for conducting analytical reviews of progress and performance of their health sector to make informed decisions, representing more than 75% of the world population.  An environment that enables data use for policy and action is critical for ensuring the effective use of health data. Almost 60% of countries have good capacity for using data and evidence to drive policy and planning, but only 42% of countries have good capacity for data access and sharing; 32% of the countries have good capacity for a national digital health strategy based on recommended standards.In summary, while some countries have achieved a sustainable capacity in key areas,   no country has a fully mature health information system capable of meeting its evolving needs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/score-technical-package

Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible.Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings.  Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response includes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities. The document is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19

Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response.Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response, developed by WHO and partners, includes guidance on how to deliver preventive therapies for pregnant women and young children in ways that protect health workers and communities against potential COVID-19 transmission.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19
e8860205-fabc-4427-bd1e-ff51d693e695,Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment?,"WHO guidance remains the same. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19
ef34153f-5400-4dff-a654-cc7f64c0bd3c,What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?,"In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19

Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19
4cf8f657-9f9c-4306-afc6-7caa0b359148,Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas?,"Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.A modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic.In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers.

Since the early days of the pandemic, there have been reports of disruptions in the supply chains of essential malaria commodities – such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medicines – resulting from lockdowns and from a suspension of the importation and exportation of goods in response to COVID-19. WHO and partners are working together to ensure the availability of key malaria control tools, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease, and that efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 do not compromise access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19
dcba319e-8f49-4cbb-8e85-3f2d0addb756,What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?,"WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including the more than 80 studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. To date, 3 large randomized controlled trials, including the WHO Solidarity trial, have failed to show that the use of hydroxychloroquine among hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 can prevent death or disease progression. Additionally, 3 trials of patients with mild or moderate disease failed to show a significant benefit in prevention of respiratory failure through the use of hydroxychloroquine. Thus, there is now growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This evidence will inform the next update of WHO guidance on therapeutics. Studies on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent individuals, particularly those at high risk such as health care workers, from contracting COVID-19 are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to assess the protective efficacy of either of these medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 infection or disease. WHO cautions physicians against administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 outside the context of a clinical trial. Individuals are also advised against self-medicating with these drugs.For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19
e7169628-78f7-4e1d-b8dc-5d73acd9b52e,What is WHO’s position on the use of Artemisia plant material for the prevention or treatment of malaria and/or COVID-19?,"The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. There have been reports that products or extracts (e.g. herbal teas or tablets) made from Artemisia plant material may have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. However, available in vitro data suggests that purified artemisinin compounds or A. annua plant product or extracts do not have an appreciable effect against COVID-19 at concentrations that could be safely achieved in humans. As such, current evidence does not support the use of artemisinins or A. annua products or extracts as an antiviral for COVID-19. WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement, there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from Artemisia-based plant material.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19

The work is being carried out in close collaboration with colleagues based at WHO headquarters, regional offices and country level.In March 2020, before the pandemic had secured a strong footing in Africa, WHO sounded an urgent call for maintaining core malaria prevention and treatment services while protecting health workers and communities against COVID-19 transmission. The findings of a modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published in April, reinforced the WHO call for continuity of malaria services during then pandemic.In collaboration with partners, WHO developed technical guidance for countries on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19

In addition, WHO advocates at the global and local levels to promote behaviour change. The global level strategy includes the organization of high-level events about attacks on health care, collaborations with partners involved in this field and social media campaigns. At the local level, WHO raises awareness about the importance of addressing attacks, distributes and shares information to support the response, negotiates for better access to health and collaborates with partners who have activities at the operational level.Finally, WHO has invested in the development of a body of research looking at the impact of attacks on health care and the documentation of good practices for prevention and protection measures.

During emergencies, attacks come in so many shapes and forms that solutions to address them must be locally adapted in order to be effective. When addressing attacks on health care, it is important to keep in mind that incidents of attacks should not be viewed as isolated events, but as one piece of a larger problem. By conducting thorough context analyses, health care providers can adapt their protective measures to address the challenges posed by the local political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical contexts in which they operate. For this reason, WHO is conducting research on drivers of violence in various contexts and will provide a framework to conduct context analyses in emergency countries. Furthermore, WHO documents good practices undertaken by various actors to prevent attacks and mitigate their impact in emergency countries. Although each “practice”
is dependent on the context in which they occur, there are aspects that can be generalized across operations to allow for better protection against attacks.  These resources will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors, authorities, communities and other stakeholders to generate effective solutions to address attacks on health care at country-level.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/preventing-protecting-against-attacks

It is caused by two species of parasitic flatworms or trematodes that mainly affect the liver. The two species of trematodes that cause fascioliasis (Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica) are leaf-shaped worms, large enough to be visible to the naked eye (adult F. hepatica measure 20–30 mm x 13 mm; adult F. gigantica measure 25–75 mm x 12 mm).

89c6249d-cad8-4ae4-9626-8bd757b2d58a,Where does fascioliasis occur?,"Until recently, human cases occurred occasionally but are now increasingly reported from Europe, the Americas and Oceania (where only F. hepatica is transmitted) and from Africa and Asia (where the two species overlap). WHO estimates that at least 2.4 million people are infected in more than 75 countries worldwide, with several million at risk. No continent is free from fascioliasis, and it is likely that where animal cases are reported, human cases also exist.The epidemiological pattern of fascioliasis is quite varied: the infection usually has a hypo-endemic pattern, with low and stable levels of prevalence among a defined population. Sporadic outbreaks may occur among such populations: these are usually related to sudden changes in climatic conditions that boost the life-cycle of either the parasite or the snail, or both. Scientists have also found that the epidemiology of fascioliasis is strictly linked to the geographical and environmental characteristics of the area where transmission occurs, and different patterns can be distinguished: this suggests that fascioliasis may adapt to different ecological niches.In Africa and Asia, where both F. hepatica and F. gigantica are present, mixed infections are possible. In Asia, hybridization among the two species occurring in co-infected humans or animals has been described. The offspring resulting from such hybridization is characterized by intermediate morphological characteristics between the two species as well as by different ploidies (diploid, triploid, and mixoploid); such worms are frequently non-fertile.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-fascioliasis
5e9bc995-dda4-423b-97a5-e22190c9bb6d,How is fascioliasis transmitted?,"The life-cycle of fascioliasis is complex. It involves a final host (where the adult worm lives), an intermediate host (where the larval stages of the worm develop) and a carrier (entailing suitable aquatic plants).The process starts when infected animals (cattle, sheep, buffaloes, donkeys and pigs but also horses, goats, dromedaries, camels, llamas and other herbivores) defecate in fresh-water sources. Since the worm lives in the bile ducts of such animals, its eggs are evacuated in faeces and hatch into larvae that lodge in a particular type of water snail (the intermediate host).Once in the snail, the larvae reproduce and eventually release more larvae into the water. These larvae swim to nearby aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, where they attach to the leaves and stems and form small cysts (metacercariae). When the plants with the small cysts attached are ingested, they act as carriers of the infection. Watercress and water-mint are good plants for transmitting fascioliasis, but encysted larvae may also be found on many other salad vegetables. Ingestion of free metacercariae floating on water (possibly detached from carrier plants) may also be a possible mode of transmission.Transmission of the infection in the environment is usually perpetuated by animals. Humans do not typically contribute to the parasite's life-cycle; they are only occasionally infected after failure to observe basic hygiene measures (consuming larvae-contaminated uncooked vegetables or drinking larvae-infected water). Moreover, Fasciola worms are not well adapted to humans and, in some cases, fail to develop into mature adult worms and produce eggs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-fascioliasis

This pattern is possibly explained by a human-to-snail-to-plant-to-human transmission cycle, without the involvement of any animal. Indigenous communities in the South American highlands represent well known ""hot spots"" for fascioliasis: here, highly prevalent infection has been reported and may be explained by such transmission pathway.Where it occurs sporadically, fascioliasis affects people from all age-groups, and there is no specific risk group. Where the infection is highly endemic, the prevalence and intensity of infection tend to peak in school-age children. People living in rural areas are typically more likely to become infected; however, cases may occur anywhere and can follow the trade routes of the carrier plants, which are part of the usual diet in many countries.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-fascioliasis

This is followed by an acute and a chronic clinical phase.Acute phase. The acute phase, lasting 2-4 months, begins when the immature worms penetrate the intestinal wall and the peritoneum, the protective membrane surrounding the internal organs . From here, they puncture the liver's surface and eat their way through its tissues until they reach the bile ducts. This invasion kills the liver's cells and causes intense internal bleeding. Typical symptoms include fever, nausea, a swollen liver, skin rashes and extreme abdominal pain.Chronic phase. The chronic phase begins when the worms reach the bile ducts, where they mature and start producing eggs. These eggs are released into the bile and reach the intestine, where they are evacuated in faeces, thereby completing the transmission cycle. Symptoms include intermittent pain, jaundice and anaemia.

Diagnostic protocols adapted to the socioeconomic environment of endemic areas should be adopted, and triclabendazole should be made available to peripheral health centres with the aim of increasing access to treatment.In communities where cases are clustered, possibilities for implementing large-scale anthelminthic distribution (preventive chemotherapy) in subdistricts, villages or communities where the cluster occurs should be considered. Preventive chemotherapy in such foci can be implemented as targeted treatment of school-age children (5–14 years), usually the population with the highest prevalence and intensity of infection, or as universal treatment (mass drug administration, or MDA) of the entire resident population. In such areas, individual-level diagnosis is not necessary; decisions about treatment are rather based on an assessment of the public health relevance of the disease.Timely treatment with triclabendazole is the quickest way to control morbidity associated with fascioliasis. However, treatment should be complemented, where feasible, by implementing measures that aim to reduce transmission rates, including:information, education and communication, promoting cultivation of vegetables in water free from faecal pollution and thorough cooking of vegetables before consumption;veterinary public health measures, including treating domestic animals and enforcing separation between husbandry and humans;environmental measures such as containment of the snail intermediate hosts and drainage of grazing lands.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-fascioliasis

bfff13cc-3de5-4929-91a0-8089dd72daa5,What are the symptoms of clonorchiasis?,"In humans, acute clonorchiasis may be asymptomatic or scarcely symptomatic in light infections, but if the number of worms is significant (up to several thousands), fever and right upper-quadrant pain are not infrequent and may be associated with intermittent colic pain caused by the worms obstructing the gallbladder.Chronic clonorchiasis, which results from protracted episodes of re-infection over time, may be most severe. The presence of the worms in the walls of the smaller bile ducts causes chronic inflammation, resulting in fibrosis of the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. Cholangiohepatitis, or recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, is also frequent. Chronic chlonorchiasis is strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma, a severe and often fatal form of bile duct cancer.

pollutant emission monitoring, land-use and urban planning, and sustainable consumption.

Policy makers and citizens need to know the sources of air pollutants and their contributions to air
pollution in each location, and this information should guide effective emission control strategies.

be informed about the complexity of the issue and of the relative importance of the sources.
Successful communication approaches to the public should include communication on local,
personal, feasible actions that can be undertaken by individuals to mitigate air pollution. People are
motivated by a sense of self-efficacy and neglect hazards that they cannot reduce.

However, communication strategies should be tailored to the geography, economic conditions,
culture, expectations and norms in each setting. Messages should be specific for the general public
and for sensitive individuals. Help in adapting messages can be provided by social structures such
as schools and other educational facilities, local and regional administrative structures, and institutions of the civil society, such as patients organizations, professional societies, and specific interest

common tool for the reporting and communication of the state of air quality at the city or at regional
level on as short-term basis. Ideally, it expresses air quality in easily understood terms. AQI is also used

groups, it can reduce exposure to air pollution through individual behaviour modification, while public authorities ensure a timely reduction of emissions activities. These interventions by their very
nature are only used sporadically, therefore their effectiveness depends on whether individuals
have information that is applicable, reliable, and understandable and if relevant actions are feasible
in the affected population.

Often, these indices summarize several air pollutant concentrations in one number, which makes it
difficult to isolate the effect of one specific pollutant. For example, in some cases the same index
can result from a combination of low particle and high ozone exposure or a combination of high
particle and low ozone concentration. As patients are often not affected by all pollutants, a combined index makes it more difficult to react accordingly.

Even indices that have been specifically designed based on health research have been mostly based
on long term population-level health risks.

who are more susceptible have an increased response to exposure to air pollution. This increased
response comes from an innate or acquired predisposition, such as pre-existing conditions or
diseases. Moreover, some people are more vulnerable, which means they have an increased
exposure, which is due to external factors such as place of residence, type of occupation, or
internal factors such as increased ventilation (children), etc.

occur during major pollution episodes, however, greatest health benefit is likely to happen when
exposure reduction occurs on in the long run, reducing risk of chronic harm.

cooking, active and passive smoking, incense burning – in addition to the infiltration of air pollutants from outdoors to indoors, which in turn is a function of many factors (e.g. type of ventilation,
building specificities, etc.). During acute episodes of air pollution, emergency interventions may be applied by local authorities, including school closures and limitation of sports events, as part of a risk management

or any activities undertaken while working, playing, or carrying out household chores.
Physical activity has significant health benefits and contributes to prevent non-communicable
diseases. On the other hand, physical activity may influence the uptake and deposit of air pollutants in the lungs and airways. At higher air pollutants concentrations, more air pollutants will be

practice), and for susceptible subpopulations (children, old, people with pre-existing conditions).

Specifically, evidence on short-term impacts suggest that air pollution diminishes (but not eliminate) the beneficial effects of physical activity, in populations with diseases such as cardiovascular
and respiratory conditions and for those who are healthy. In the long-term, studies suggest that
air pollution slightly reduces the protective effect of physical activity on mortality. Also, modelling

optimal. Whenever possible, people should adapt the timing and location of physical activity to
reduce exposure to air pollution. Any recommendation should include consideration of ozone and
temperature levels, especially in warmer climates. Patients who take medication should follow
their physician’s recommendations.

sealing measures (e.g. closing windows) for CO2, and noise.
The high cost of maintenance (e.g. changing filters) and equitable access issues need to be

out PM2.5 particles, including smoke or ash particles. Respirators have primarily been developed
to protect workers in high exposure work places. Filtering facepiece respirators are made entirely
of filter material and are the most common type of air-purifying particulate respirators.

 
There are well-established occupational certifications, recommendations and protocols for respirator use. The general public should be cautious when purchasing products advertised online

a respirator is effective :

Putting it on correctly.
Ensuring that it fits properly.
Using it continuously during exposure.
Replacing the respirator or the filter when it becomes saturated.
Confirming that it has been approved to remove ≥ 95 % of particles.

 
Because of differences in facial structures across the world, no one respirator can be guaranteed
to fit all users. There are no commercial respirators designed for children (based on information
available as of February 2019). There is, to date. no information on the application of well-established occupational recommendations and protocols for respirator use by the public and who

In the absence of any preventive interventions, the risk of transmission from mother to child ranges from 70% to 90% for mothers with high HBV viral load (or are HBeAg-positive) and from 10% to 40% for those that are HBeAg negative. These high maternal concentrations of HBV DNA (viral load) are associated with an elevated risk of transmission, even among infants who receive the hepatitis B vaccine.

According to latest WHO estimates, the proportion of children under five years of age chronically infected with HBV dropped to just under 1% in 2019 down from around 5% in the pre-vaccine era (the period between the 1980s and the early 2000s).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
b7c3057d-f089-4285-ba78-3cc2d8fffe43,Why are new guidelines on use of antivirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission needed?,"WHO already recommends that all infants receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours, and that the birth dose be followed by at least 2 additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine, administered at least four weeks apart. In the 2015 WHO guidelines for prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic HBV infection, no recommendation was made for the additional use of antiviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission. This was because of the still limited and low-quality evidence base with several ongoing trials, and the lack of consensus as to the programmatic implications of a policy for more widespread use of antivirals in pregnancy. The new recommendations were prompted by 3 key developments. First, additional evidence has become available on the efficacy and safety of antiviral prophylaxis in pregnant women and their children. Second, WHO has received requests for updated guidance from countries and regions that had already achieved high birth dose and infant vaccination coverage but had not yet achieved the 2030 WHO elimination target of less than 0.1% prevalence of HBV in 5-year-old children. Third, data from epidemiological studies and modelling suggest that infant vaccination alone would insufficient to reach the WHO goal of 0.1% HBsAg prevalence in children by 2030, and that antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women may also be needed in some contexts.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
60dab64c-2e37-4118-86b9-35f310c14857,What are the new WHO recommendations for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection?,"There are 2 new recommendations:In addition to the series of hepatitis B vaccinations (including a first dose within 24 hours of birth), WHO now recommends that pregnant women testing positive for HBV infection (HBsAg positive) with an HBV DNA viral load threshold of ≥5.3 log10
IU/mL (≥200,000 IU/mL) receive tenofovir prophylaxis; the preventive therapy should be provided from the 28th week of pregnancy until at least birth. (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).In settings where antenatal HBV DNA testing is not available, WHO now recommends the use of HBeAg testing as an alternative to determine eligibility for tenofovir prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).  This is because some settings have poor access to tests that quantify an individual’s HBV viral load and determine whether a pregnant woman would be eligible for preventive treatment or prophylaxis. This
is especially the case in low-income settings or, rural areas where many antenatal care visits take place.Pregnant women should first be assessed for eligibility for long-term antiviral treatment based on their own health needs. If this is the case, the treatment they will receive will also ensure prophylaxis.  The indications for treatment in HBV-infected pregnant women are the same as that for non-pregnant adults, and are outlined in the 2015 Guidelines for the prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
f9e505c3-4c40-4ce0-a928-d0ee0c1bb48d,What is the evidence to support these new recommendations?,"Evidence to inform the recommendations included two commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses, impact and cost-effectiveness modelling, an assessment of the overall balance of benefits and harms (at individual and population levels), patient/health worker values and preferences, resource use, cost-effectiveness, considerations on equity and human rights, and considerations of feasibility across the different WHO regions. A WHO-commissioned systematic review of 129 studies showed a substantial protective effect of using antiviral prophylaxis in preventing mother-to-child transmission in infants born to HBV-infected women, regardless of the antiviral used. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the medicine of choice for treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection and also prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and has a high barrier to development of drug resistance. Use of TDF was also safe.  The Guidelines Development Group also determined an HBV DNA viral load threshold of ≥5.3 log10 IU/mL (≥200,000 IU/mL) at which pregnant women are eligible to receive tenofovir prophylaxis. This is because pregnant woman with a viral load above this level may transmit HBV to their infant even when the infant receives the timely birth dose vaccine, HBIG and completes the full hepatitis B vaccine series. Although HBV DNA measurement is the reference method to determine eligibility for tenofovir prophylaxis, the use of HBeAg was recommended as an acceptable alternative test in settings where access to HBV DNA quantification is limited. This was based on a further systematic review that showed the overall sensitivity and specificity of HBeAg for diagnosis of high HBV viral load (defined as ≥5.3 log10 IU/mL) was 88.2% (95% CI: 83.9–91.5) and 92.6% (95% CI: 90–94.5) respectively. Overall, HBeAg has a high sensitivity but lower specificity for predicting the risk of mother-to-child transmission. A global values and preferences survey showed a broad level of acceptability of HBV testing in pregnant women with use of antivirals in those eligible, but concerns about potential costs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
a1c3f65c-0e2e-4576-b103-34bb47184e3d,How feasible will it be to implement these new recommendations?,"Experience from elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis suggests that providing testing for pregnant women followed by antiviral prophylaxis for eligible women to prevent infection is feasible. Programmes aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV are the most mature and have shown remarkable success. For example, by the end of 2018, approximately 79% of pregnant women globally knew their HIV status, and 82% of those who tested positive for HIV received treatment. However, although the majority of women are offered HIV testing at antenatal care visits, the same is not yet true for syphilis or HBV testing. An online consultation held in 2019 as part of the guidelines development process among 153 health care workers, 56 programme managers and 81 civil society representatives reported that 77% of respondents felt it was feasible to provide HBV testing and offer eligible pregnant women tenofovir prophylaxis. Challenges reported by stakeholders included the high cost and low availability of HBV viral load assessment, inadequate training of health care workers, limited knowledge of HBV infection among women living with HBV infection, and a lack of capacity and infrastructure to test and treat pregnant women. These issues will need to be addressed to enable full implementation of routine testing of all pregnant women, as well as the use of antivirals in those with high HBV viral load or HBeAg status.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
f68db6e8-7fa4-4db9-a489-d18488c12504,What are the key messages for countries and regions?,"WHO regions are faced with different scenarios with respect to prevalence of HBV infection, service coverage of immunization (including birth dose), and in availability of commodities for diagnostics, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment. The implementation of the different recommendations to prevent mother-to-child transmission may therefore vary by region. Universal immunization of infants with the HBV vaccine, including a timely birth dose, is the foundation of programmes to prevent HBV infection at birth and in the first years of life in all settings. Countries that have not yet reached the 2020 goal of 1% HBsAg prevalence among children aged 5 years through vaccination should focus their efforts on increasing their coverage of infant hepatitis B vaccination, and a timely birth dose. This applies particularly to the African and Eastern Mediterranean region. However, for regions and countries that have already achieved a high coverage of hepatitis B infant vaccination, and the birth dose, implementation of these new recommendations for peripartum tenofovir prophylaxis in pregnant women with high viral loads would help further prevent perinatal HBV infections. This applies particularly to countries in the Regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia. In the Americas and the European region, testing in view of prophylaxis is already been used and these guidelines can provide an additional reference.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
69025325-d5fd-404f-a065-f44ecdb61376,What are the cost-effectiveness considerations?,"Scaling up access to a timely birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is the most cost-effective option for preventing infection; this single intervention delivers the greatest health benefit for the lowest cost. However, in countries that have already achieved high hepatitis B vaccination coverage and, as a result, reduction in infections due to horizontal transmission in early childhood, mother-to-child vertical infections now account for a higher proportion of the remaining transmission. In these settings, routine testing for HBV infection among pregnant women, and providing tenofovir prophylaxis for those who are eligible, is an additional opportunity to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV. This complementary intervention may be cost-effective in some regions depending on the costs of diagnostics (ie. HBV DNA or HBeAg), and on how such a strategy is implemented.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus
74509e14-79ff-4d69-82ff-e9aeec10a01a,Are any countries already implementing the new recommendations?,"Countries in several regions with a low burden of HBV infection have gained some experience in the use of peripartum prophylaxis, especially in the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe. Further expanded implementation of the recommendations for peripartum prophylaxis would prevent more perinatal HBV infections.In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2017, 24 countries were routinely testing pregnant women for HBsAg, and 22 countries providing HBIG for exposed newborns. In the WHO European Region (mostly high-income countries with low baseline prevalence of HBV infection) some countries have not implemented universal hepatitis B vaccination but instead rely on testing all pregnant women and then providing targeted birth dose vaccine to children born to HBsAg-positive mothers.  In the WHO South East Asian Region, antiviral prophylaxis has been used in certain countries where HBV is highly endemic and mother-to-child transmission is common, such as in Thailand. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, despite achieving overall high vaccination coverage including birth dose, there are some countries that still have a very high HBV prevalence in the general population and also large populations. As a result, breakthrough infections that occur despite vaccination still account for a significant number of mother-to-child infections.  A number of these countries have spearheaded efforts to further reduce mother-to-child transmission, including the use of antiviral prophylaxis and follow up of exposed infants. For example, in China, universal antenatal testing for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis has been offered since 2011, and comprehensive interventions including antiviral prophylaxis were established in three provinces as part of pilot projects on triple elimination. Other countries, have established pilot projects for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HBV in four states (Malaysia), updated national guidelines for EMTCT to include HBV and HCV (Mongolia), developed triple elimination national action plans (Cambodia and Vietnam) or frameworks (Philippines and Papua New Guinea).In the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, experience with peripartum prophylaxis is still very limited, and the priority is to expand coverage of vaccination that remains heterogeneous.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus

To illustrate, the reasons behind the destruction of a health facility in Libya may be drastically different from those that motivated the destruction of a health centre in DRC during an Ebola outbreak. In Libya, the shelling of a health facility occurs against the backdrop of years of violent conflict, in which attacks on health care have become one of its manifestations. On the other hand, the attacks that took place in DRC during the 2014 Ebola outbreak seem to have targeted health facilities as a reaction to imposed public health measures. At this stage, more research is needed to identify drivers of violence against health care, but looking at the local contexts in which they occur already provides useful clues.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/attacks-on-health-care-initiative

f208a9fa-c93a-4d64-89d3-7e1aa4060eea,Why do we need to transition polio assets?,"The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategy identifies three main aims of transition planning:Keep the world polio freeAfter polio has been eradicated, some activities and functions of the polio programme will need to continue to make sure the world stays polio-free. These include:Proper containment of the virus in essential facilities so it isn’t accidentally or intentionally releasedDisease surveillance, to rapidly detect the re-emergence of the virusOutbreak response capabilities, for quick and effective response to any polio eventsContinued vaccination, so that people are protected in the event of an outbreakA governance and management structure for these ongoing essential functionsNational governments, WHO and other GPEI partners must plan for some essential functions and activities to be incorporated into existing public health programs in order to keep the world polio-free. In consultation with key stakeholders, GPEI is developing a polio Post-Certification Strategy to define, at a global level, the technical standards that will be needed in order to maintain a polio-free world.Transition polio assets to support other health prioritiesGPEI funds have established an extensive infrastructure of global disease surveillance systems, vaccine supply and logistics networks, and a network of more than 140 polio laboratories. These capacities help reach populations in areas with little to no infrastructure.Given that GPEI-funded infrastructure already supports a wide range of health initiatives like routine immunization, measles campaigns, maternal and child health programmes, humanitarian emergencies and disease outbreak, and sanitation and hygiene programmes, the closure of the polio programme therefore presents a potential risk to these programmes.Capture and transfer the lessons learnedThe polio programme, over many decades, has learned many valuable lessons on reaching hard-to-reach and high-risk populations, working in conflict affected areas, harnessing global commitment to a cause, and other challenging areas. A key component of transition planning is to capture and share these lessons for the benefit of the broader development community.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/polio-transition
5aaf94ed-b61d-4ff6-b0d3-0c5ebcef5a8d,What is the process of polio transition planning?,"Transition planning is a process of analysing the infrastructure, knowledge, and functions of the polio programme, and managing their scale down or transfer to other health programmes.The process involves mapping these assets at country, regional and global levels, and conducting an analysis against national and global health and development needs.At the country level, within the 16 polio priority transition countries (Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan), significant efforts are under way to ensure government ownership of the national polio transition planning process, systematic mapping of all polio assets, identification of key public health priorities that could benefit from the polio infrastructure, engagement of stakeholders, development of a costed national polio transition plan, and the development of a financing strategy for implementing the transition plan. WHO, at all three organizational levels, and partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative have been extensively involved in this process.Within WHO, polio transition planning is a corporate, WHO-wide priority. Polio transition planning will have to address the risks and opportunities facing the organization. It will need to deal with managing the significant human resources, financing, country capacity, and programmatic risks faced by the organization as a result of the scaling down of the polio programme. It will also be an opportunity for the organization to integrate the polio assets and capacities to strengthen health systems in countries to help achieve the goals of the 13th General Programme of Work of WHO and the SDGs.An effective and strategic polio transition plan will ensure that essential functions are maintained in countries, either through national systems or other WHO programme areas, in order to sustain a polio-free world. The plan will also endeavour to strengthen immunization services and emergency preparedness and response capacities in polio transition countries through the integration of polio assets and functions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/polio-transition

This should be done for each specific work setting and each job.Low exposure risk Jobs or work without frequent, close contact with the general public or others. Workers in this group have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers. Examples of such jobs may include remote workers (i.e., working from home), office workers without frequent close contact with others and workers providing teleservices.Medium exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close, frequent contact with the general public or others. This risk level may apply to workers who have frequent and close contact with the people in high-population-density work environments (e.g. food markets, bus stations, public transport, and other work activities where physical distancing of at least 1 metre may be difficult to observe), or tasks that require close and frequent contact between co-workers. This may also include frequent contact with people returning from areas with community transmission. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, home deliveries, accommodation, construction, police and security, public transport, and water and sanitation. High exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close contact with people who may be more likely to have COVID-19, as well as contact with objects and surfaces possibly contaminated with the virus. Examples include transporting people known or suspected to have COVID-19 without separation between the driver and the passenger, providing domestic services or home care for people with COVID-19, and having contact with the deceased who were known or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death.

Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with. In order to support compliance with national or local recommendations, implement physical distance guidelines in a way that is practical and feasible in the context of work tasks, and which is acceptable to both workers and employers. Stimulate workers to comply with physical distancing norms also at events outside the workplace, in the community, and in dormitories. Risk assessment and consultation between employers and workers is very important for setting up and implementing physical distancing measures at the workplace. This may require modification of workstations, changing the use of common spaces and transport vehicles, staggered work shifts, split teams and other measures to reduce social mixing at the workplace. If physical distancing measures at the workplace are not feasible for specific work tasks, consider whether the work can be suspended, and if this is not possible, apply additional protective measures, such as the use of screens, sneeze guards,  face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, ventilation and disinfection.Physical distancing alone can’t prevent COVID-19 transmission, it is important that it is combined with other public health measures, such as hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental clean-up and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects, ventilation, wearing face masks and a policy of staying at home if unwell.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace

3ceb4877-a240-4110-8bc5-1463380f6edf,How can I respond to changes in the person with dementia?,"As dementia progresses, the person with dementia may change. Changes may include agitation, depression, anxiety or apathy, becoming withdrawn or overly suspicious, having difficulty sleeping or changes in judgement. The person may also show signs of confusion, deterioration of existing cognitive problems (e.g. memory), delusions and hallucinations, and repetitive behaviours or wandering. Identify the changes and what appears to be triggering them. Think about the best ways to respond that will be the least distressing to you and the person with dementia. Try different responses and approaches – your first response may not always work.If the person has serious and constant mood changes or if you think that they are in danger of harming themselves, seek immediate medical advice.For more information see iSupportModule 5 Dealing with behavior changes, Lesson 1 Introduction to behavior changes and Lesson 4 Depression, anxiety and apathy. Lessons 2 through 9 provide additional information about other behavior changes.

d7f7f422-38e5-432e-ac49-03e0f8554ab9,How can I provide everyday care to the person with dementia?,"As dementia progresses, you may need to provide more care that you are currently doing. Make sure that the person is eating and drinking. You may need to regularly remind them to do so. Adjust their diet according to their preferences and health. Remember to keep inedible items, sharp objects, household chemicals and flammable materials in a safe place. Modifying the environment can help reduce incontinence accidents. For example, put a picture of a toilet on the bathroom door. Remind the person to go to the bathroom regularly. Consider using incontinence aids and equipment if necessary. Do not blame the person for accidents. Engage the person in personal care by helping them do as much as they can themselves. Try modifying the environment, for example by switching from a shower to a sponge bath, and provide guidance. Be mindful of falls – use a non-slip shower or bath mat. The person with dementia may resist when you try to assist with personal care. Be compassionate and try to understand why.It is important to maintain routines similar to the ones that the person had before developing dementia. Be prepared to adapt routines as necessary as the abilities of the person change over time.For more information see iSupportModule 4 Providing everyday care, Lessons 1 Eating and drinking – more pleasant mealtimes, 2 Eating, drinking and preventing health problems, 3 Toileting and continence care, and 4 Personal care.

0335955a-a90e-4c60-87bb-ce53281ccb53,How can I communicate effectively with the person with dementia?,"Dementia can often make communication difficult. This can have an impact on your relationship with the person you care for and can be frustrating, upsetting or irritating for both of you. Get attention in a respectful way. Speak clearly, slowly and at a volume that is comfortable for them. Speak face-to-face and at eye level. You might also try lightly tapping a hand, arm or front of the shoulder, or calling the person by their name or a nickname that they recognize.Ask or tell the person with dementia one thing at a time. Use short sentences and simple words that the person with dementia can understand. Repeat information calmly, as often as necessary. When needed, change from open-ended to close-ended questions that can be answered by yes or no. Make sure that there are no distracting background noises such as a television or radio.Try to stay in control of your feelings. Sometimes, you might not understand what the person you care for is trying to say. It is important that you take the person seriously – they are trying to tell you something. Be patient and give the person time to find their words. Pay attention to their reactions, including facial expressions and body language. Show compassion about the feelings that the person expresses. Remember that saying something positive or complimenting the person can make them feel good.For more information see iSupportModule 2 Being a caregiver, Lessons 1 The journey together and 2 Improving communication.

all personnel need lifelong learning in health. Continued professional education and development is limited to a few high-status professions and are not equitably available where they are most needed in low- and middle-income countries. This means
that global and national ambitions to meet goals for health, such as the Sustainable Development Goal 3, are unlikely to be met. In the current situation, 95% of countries are on target NOT to meet SDG3. The fourth industrial revolution that we are
currently experiencing not only provide unprecedented and fast evolution in digital technology and biotechnology, but also requires millions of personnel to continuously learn new knowledge and skills and to upskill themselves even if they remain
in the same jobs, especially in health. Training and education in health require lifelong learning but using approaches that everyone can benefit from it.

However, ova are not always concurrently present, and current laboratory methods have a low sensitivity to confirm their presence.
Lesions associated with genital schistosomiasis may mimic a host of infections and premalignant or malignant conditions. It is therefore crucial to identify alterations that are pathognomic. Differential diagnosis must be done systematically to screen
for cancers (of the vulva, vagina, cervix, endometrium), sexually transmitted infections and urogenital tuberculosis.Clinical diagnosis of female genital schistosomiasis is mainly done by visual inspection and histological methods.The WHO Female Genital Schistosomiasis Pocket Atlas and related Clinical Poster are visual aides that have been developed for clinical health-care professionals

Few studies reported that praziquantel has no effect on established grainy lesions. However, elimination of adult worms prevents further egg deposition in the tissues and thus development of new lesions. Early treatment, especially in childhood, is the most effective intervention to prevent the occurrence and development of complications associated with urogenital schistosomiasis.The widespread lack of awareness of genital schistosomiasis leads to misdiagnosis and, therefore, false and ineffective therapy . As female genital schistosomiasis is rarely diagnosed correctly, knowledge about the effect of treatment is also scanty. Incorrect diagnostic of genital schistosomiasis lesions frequently leads to debilitating and irreversible operations such as ovarectomy, salpingotomiy and hysterectomy.

In most cases, a person who is infected by the parasite has neither symptoms nor signs of infection and is not considered to have leishmaniasis. Although there are some 20 different parasites that cause the disease, there are only three different types of leishmaniasis.The most common type (CL) causes skin lesions, mainly nodules or painless ulcers. The second type (VL, also known as kala-azar) is a life-threatening disease that causes anaemia (deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells), fever, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen and significant weight loss. VL is invariably fatal if left untreated.

7a2e567d-00ee-4e5c-ba2b-bc7b3cb7efda,How are Leishmania parasites transmitted?,"Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of a tiny –2–3 mm long – female insect vector, the phlebotomine sandfly. There are some 800 known phlebotomine species, but only about 30 have been found to transmit Leishmania parasites. Only female sandflies can transmit the parasites; they need blood for their eggs to develop and become infected with Leishmania when they suck blood from an infected person or animal. Over a period of 4–25 days, the parasites develop in the sandfly. When the infectious female sandfly then feeds on a fresh source of blood, it inoculates the person or animal with the parasite, and the transmission cycle is completed.Phlebotomine sandflies are found throughout the intertropical and temperate regions of the world. The female sandfly lays its eggs in the burrows of certain rodents, the bark of old trees, ruins, cracks in the walls of houses, animal shelters and household rubbish, where the larvae can find the organic matter, heat and humidity they need to develop. In its search for blood (usually in the evening and at night), the female sandfly can cover a distance of up to several hundred metres around its habitat.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/leishmaniasis
47aba358-f80a-4540-b06e-ef43cde56a9c,Why is leishmaniasis important?,"The different types of leishmaniasis last months or years, causing stigmatization, stress, mutilation, weakness, prostration or eventual death if treatment is not available, depending on the causative parasite and the underlying condition of the patient. Since the disease can start as a mild, slowly progressing condition, it may take a long time before patients seek medical care or before they are diagnosed by a health practitioner who may not be familiar with the disease or where there are no appropriate health services close to where patients reside.Leishmaniasis is closely linked to poverty. Factors that increase the risk of infection include poor housing conditions and environmental sanitation, lack of personal protective measures, and economically driven migration and employment that bring nonimmune people into contact with infected sandflies. Poverty is associated with poor nutrition and other infectious diseases, which increase the risk of an infected person progressing to clinical manifestations of the disease.Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis are expensive when they are not offered free of charge in the public sector. Consequently, families must sell their assets and take loans to pay for care, leading to further impoverishment and reinforcing the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. Public investment in leishmaniasis would decrease the burden of the disease and alleviate poverty.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/leishmaniasis

The main signs are prolonged irregular bouts of fever, enlarged spleen and/or loss of weight. Other signs and symptoms include anaemia, enlarged liver, cough, diarrhoea and enlarged lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, lack specificity and mimic those of malaria, malnutrition, typhoid, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and other systemic diseases. Signs of malnutrition manifest with the progression of disease, with intercurrent[1] infections. In areas co‐endemic for malaria, kala-azar should be suspected when fever lasts for 2 weeks or longer and no response has been observed with antimalarial medicines (assuming that drug‐resistant malaria has been ruled out).  PKDL is characterized by patchy and raised hypopigmented rashes. It mainly occurs in areas endemic for L. donovani in East Africa and South Asia. Late manifestations are plaques, papules or nodular and infiltrative lesions, especially on the face. Most PKDL cases occur in patients previously treated for VL.

The clinical spectrum is very broad and varies between and within endemic regions and depends upon several factors including parasite species or immunological status or type of zoonotic cycle involved. Classically, a typical lesion starts as a papule or nodule at the site of inoculation of the bite of the infected sandfly that grows slowly to develop a painless ulcer with surrounding induration. Lesions may not heal and require specific treatment, or spontaneously heal gradually over months or years, often resulting in a disfiguring scar with altered pigmentation. Lesions lack specificity and closely resemble many skin conditions such as cutaneous tuberculosis, fungal infection, impetigo, leprosy, psoriasis, tropical ulcer, venous leg ulcers, verruca or zona.MCL lesions can lead to partial or total destruction of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues.

These methods include serological tests or microscopic demonstration of parasites, culture or PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Parasite identification remains the gold standard of diagnosis.In areas endemic for VL, the disease can be diagnosed at primary health care level or in rural district hospitals using the rK39-based rapid diagnostic test, which produces results in less than 30 minutes.For PKDL, diagnosis is generally clinical and can be confirmed by skin smears or skin biopsies.CL is usually diagnosed clinically in highly endemic areas where only one type of infection exists.

Therefore, confirmation of disease is important before initiating treatment. Several factors determine the choice of therapy, such as clinical form of leishmaniasis, parasite species, endemic region, health service setting, drug policy in endemic countries, availability of antileishmanial medicines, other morbid conditions and individual benefit–risk ratio of medicines. In certain cases, supportive treatment such as nutritional supplementation or rehydration blood transfusion may be required before starting therapy. Wherever possible, cases should be managed under medical supervision.VL is a life-threatening condition, and the aim of the treatment is to cure the patient, reduce the risk of relapse and reduce transmission of resistant parasites.

recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. Some causes and
triggers are common to all people with asthma, and some are more
individual. Although the fundamental causes of asthma are not completely

inhaled asthma triggers. These include:
indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander); outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds);tobacco smoke; andchemical irritants in the workplace. Other triggers can include cold air, extreme emotional arousal
such as anger or fear, and physical exercise. In some people, asthma
can even be triggered by certain medications, such as aspirin and other
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers (which are used
to treat high blood pressure, heart conditions and migraine).
Urbanization has also been associated with an increase in asthma,

Using a “spacer” device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler and helps the medicine to reach the lungs more effectively. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end, and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A home-made spacer, made from a 500-ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as a commercially-manufactured inhaler. People with ongoing symptoms will need to take daily medication for the long-term. It’s also important for people living with asthma to avoid triggers. With medical support, individuals should learn what their own triggers are and take steps to avoid them.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chronic-respiratory-diseases-asthma

Events in early life affect the developing lungs and can increase the risk of asthma. These include low-birth weight, prematurity, exposure to tobacco smoke and other sources of air pollution, as well as viral respiratory infections. Exposure to a range of environmental allergens and irritants are also thought to increase the risk of asthma, including indoor and outdoor air pollution, house dust mites, moulds, and occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or dust.Children and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk of asthma.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/chronic-respiratory-diseases-asthma

Masks?,"Disposable GlovesGloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves.Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required.Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing. Hand sanitisers can be used as an additional measure but should not replace hand washing.Wearing of Face MasksWHO advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 should be followed. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice.WHO recommends that face masks should be used if a person is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or looking after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.However, a food worker who is sick or who has symptoms of COVID-19 should not be allowed to work in grocery stores or other food businesses and should be excluded from work until free of symptoms or deemed fit for work by a medical doctor.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses

However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people.
If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the
food premise.The employee who is unwell should follow national guidelines for reporting cases/suspect cases of COVID-19. Whilst they wait for medical advice or to be sent home, they should avoid any contact with other employees. They should avoid touching people,
surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do not have any tissues available, they should
cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical assistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available.All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been
shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties.
All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection.If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to notify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take measures to minimise further risk of spread. WHO definitions of a contact of a COVID-19 case can be found 
here. Examples of contacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-face or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter with the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids
without adequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the same working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living in the same household as a confirmed case.WHO recommends that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last point of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had
close contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and practice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their 14-day isolation period
and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become a confirmed case, and should be managed as such.Staff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should continue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organising employees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimise disruption to work processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of COVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended.More detailed information can be found in COVID-19 and food safety: guidance for food businesses.For more information on contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases, see WHO guidance on surveillance and case definitions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses

Physical distancing is very important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. This is achieved by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals. Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. All food businesses should follow the physical distancing and hand washing guidance of WHO.The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 – 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012).

The use of PPE would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. When staff are dressed in PPE it is possible to reduce distance between workers,space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines,limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time,organise staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses

Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Centre for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recent technical report:Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, therefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission compared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses

TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight.  COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth .

This includes management of adverse drug reactions and co-morbidities, nutritional and mental health support, and restocking of the supplies of medicines. Enough TB medicines will need to be dispensed to the patient or caregiver to last until the next visit. This will limit interruption or unnecessary visits to the clinic. Mechanisms to deliver medicines at home and even to collect specimens for follow-up testing may become expedient. Home-based TB treatment is bound to become more common. Alternative arrangements to reduce clinic visits may involve limiting appointments to specific times to avoid exposure to other clinic attendees; using digital technologies to maintain treatment support. Community health workers become more critical as treatment is more decentralized.More TB patients will probably start their treatment at home and therefore limiting the risk of household transmission of TB during the first few weeks is important.

Amongst these is the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge for use on GeneXpert machines, which are machines used in TB diagnosis. WHO is currently evaluating this cartridge as well as other tests. Additional resources to roll out COVID-19 testing should be mobilized rather than relying only on existing resources that are used for TB, to ensure that the diagnostic coverage for TB is maintained as necessary.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis

Experience on joint management of both COVID-19 infection and TB remains limited. However, suspension of TB treatment in COVID-19 patients should be exceptional. TB preventive treatment, treatment for drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB disease should continue uninterrupted to safeguard the patient’s health, reduce transmission and prevent the development of drug-resistance. While treatment trials are ongoing, no medication is currently recommended for COVID-19 and therefore no cautions on drug-drug interactions are indicated at present. TB patients on treatment should nonetheless be asked if they are taking any medicines, including traditional cures, that may interact with their medication.Effective treatments to prevent TB and to treat active TB have been scaled up and are in use worldwide. The risk of death in TB patients approaches 50% if left untreated and may be higher in the elderly or in the presence of comorbidity. It is critical that TB services are not disrupted during the COVID-19 response.

936460e5-ab71-4b28-9871-40049c60d2dd,What can I do to prevent infection?,"To prevent infection, there are a five things that you can do. 1. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly. You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. You can learn how to wash your hands in this video (or this visual). If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin.  2. Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing. And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes. 3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. 4. Keep physical distance from others. If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home.  5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

1f1a5ca8-f261-4b59-884d-d838229cd485,What can older people do to prepare for COVID-19 in their community?,"There is a lot that you can do to prepare for COVID-19 in your community. Inform yourself of the special measures taken in your community as well as the services and the sources of reliable information that are availableduring the health emergency (e.g. home deliveries, psychosocial support, health ministry website, alternative access to your pension). Create a list of the basic supplies that you will need for at least two weeks and try to get these delivered where possible (e.g. non-perishable food items, household products, batteries for assistive
devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively, ask family members, caregivers, neighbours or community leaders to help with ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that your mobile phone
credit is topped up and identify a safe place to charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and friends and reach emergency services if needed.   Make a list of emergency numbers (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers, hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts (e.g. family members
and friends, main caregiver, community care worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share this list and ask your neighbours, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly, for example, by phone or video chat. Discuss with your health-care worker how your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone or video chat instead
of in person and/or revising your vaccination schedule. If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver, identify with him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide
care. Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that they can be ready to provide care in case of need.  If you are the primary caregiver of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick.
Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations in your community might be able to help. If multiple people live in your home, if possible prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not have space for self-isolation,
contact your community leaders or local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help you or other household members self-isolate. Think about what matters most to you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to develop an advanced care plan to record
your treatment and care wishes, you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust.

354ef637-4927-4a25-85e0-37d3cedefe3c,How can I keep healthy on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"You can follow these 10 steps to keep healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Keep to your regular routines as much as possible and maintain a daily schedule for yourself including sleeping, meals and activities.  Stay socially connected. Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common
hobbies together.
 
Be physically active every day. Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as
indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favourite music and dance to that. 
 Drink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals. This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases.  For nutrition advice click here.
 Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand
to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t
drink alcohol at all.
 Take breaks from news coverage about COVID-19 as prolonged exposure can cause feelings of anxiety and despair. Seek updates at specific times of the day from a reliable source like the
WHO website (click here) or national or local channels in order to help you distinguish facts from rumours or scams.  Engage in hobbies and activities that you enjoy or learn something new. Cognitive exercise such as reading a book or doing crosswords/Sudoku will keep your mind active and distract you from worrying. You can also use this time to
keep a well-being diary (click here for an example.)
 If you have ongoing health conditions, take your prescribed medicines and follow the advice of your health-care worker regarding any health visits or phone consultations.
 If you have an emergency medical condition that is not related to COVID-19, contact health emergencies immediately and ask what you should do next. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker. 
 If stress, worry, fear or sadness get in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row, seek psychosocial support from available services in your community.  If you are subject to abuse or violence from
others, tell someone you trust and report this to the relevant authorities. You can also seek support from dedicated helplines that may be available in your country.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people

During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help. Do not criticise yourself for how you feel. When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions.  You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normal
and there is no right or wrong way to feel grief. Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss. You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time. Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings. Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy. Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass).    Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one.

6d646d20-6935-47e1-898a-ffd7db9f5997,What are the health risks associated with travel?,"Destinations where accommodation, hygiene and sanitation, medical care and water quality are of a high standard pose relatively few serious risks to the health of travellers, except those with pre-existing illness. The same is true of business travellers
and tourists visiting most major cities and tourist centres and staying in good-quality accommodation. In contrast, destinations where accommodation is of poor quality, hygiene and sanitation are inadequate, medical services do not exist and clean
water is unavailable may pose serious risks for the health of travellers. This applies, for example, to personnel from emergency relief and development agencies and to tourists who venture into remote areas. In these settings, stringent precautions
must be taken to avoid illness. Travel warnings from governmental sources should be taken seriously; they are likely to have implications for travel and for travel insurance.Travellers and travel medicine practitioners should be aware of the diseases found in the destination countries. Unforeseen natural or human-made disasters may occur, and outbreaks of known or newly emerging infectious diseases are often unpredictable.The mode of transport, duration of visit and the behaviour of the traveller are important can affect the exposure to infectious diseases and will influence decisions on the need for certain vaccinations or antimalarial medication. The duration of the
visit may also determine whether the traveller is subjected to marked changes in altitude, temperature and humidity or to prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution.Understanding the purpose of the visit and the type of travel planned is critical in relation to the associated travel health risks. However, behaviour also plays an important role; for example, going outdoors in the evenings in a malaria-endemic area
without taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites may result in the traveller becoming infected with malaria. Exposure to insects, rodents or other animals, infectious agents and contaminated food and water, combined with the absence of appropriate
medical facilities, makes travel in many remote regions particularly hazardous.Whatever their destination or mode of travel, it is important that travellers be aware of the risk of accidents under the influence of alcohol or drugs and, mainly, in relation to road transport or the practice of sports.Q&A on health risks when travelling",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/travel-precautions

This consultation should take place at least 4–8 weeks before the journey and preferably earlier if long-term travel or overseas work is intended. However, last-minute travellers can also benefit from a medical consultation, even as late as the day of travel. The consultation will include information about the most important health risks (including traffic accidents), determine the need for any vaccinations and/or antimalarial medication and identify any other medical items that the traveller may require. A basic medical kit will be prescribed or provided, supplemented as appropriate to meet individual needs.Dental, gynaecological and age-appropriate examinations are advisable before prolonged travel to developing countries or to remote areas. This is particularly important for people with chronic or recurrent health problems. Travellers with underlying medical problems are strongly advised to consult a travel medicine clinic or medical practitioner to ensure that their potentially complex travel health needs are met.

This takes into account the likelihood of acquiring a disease and how serious this might be for the person concerned. The medical adviser will look at the pretravel health status of the traveller, destination(s), duration and purpose of travel, the mode of transport, standards of accommodation and food hygiene, and risky behaviour while travelling.For each disease being considered, an assessment is also made of:the availability of appropriate medical services in the destination, prophylaxis, emergency treatment packs, self-treatment kits (e.g. a travellers’ diarrhoea kit); andany associated public health risks (e.g. the risk of infecting others).Collecting the information required to make a risk assessment involves detailed questioning of the traveller. A checklist or protocol is useful to ensure that all relevant information is obtained and recorded.

Such travellers are strongly recommended to seek specialist travel health advice.AgeAir travel may cause discomfort to infants as a result of changes in cabin air pressure and is not advised for infants less than 48 hours old. Infants and young children are particularly sensitive to sudden changes in altitude and to ultraviolet radiation. They have special needs with regard to vaccinations and antimalarial precautions. They become dehydrated more easily than adults in the event of inadequate fluid intake or loss of fluid as a result of diarrhoea or vomiting. Advanced age is not necessarily more dangerous for travel if the general health status is good. Elderly people should seek medical advice before planning long-distance travel.PregnancyTravel is usually possible during pregnancy until close to the expected date of delivery, provided that the pregnancy is uncomplicated and the woman’s health is good. It is safest for pregnant women to travel during the second trimester. Airlines impose some travel restrictions in late pregnancy and in the neonatal period and it is advisable for travellers to check any restrictions directly with the relevant airline.There are some restrictions on vaccination during pregnancy.Pregnant women risk serious complications if they contract malaria or viral hepatitis E. Travel to areas endemic for these diseases should be avoided during pregnancy if possible.Thromboembolic complications are more frequent during pregnancy.Medication of any type during pregnancy should be taken only in accordance with medical advice.Travel to sleeping altitudes over 3000 m or to remote areas is not advisable during pregnancy.DisabilityPhysical disability is not usually a contraindication for travel if the general health status of the traveller is good. Airlines have regulations concerning travel for disabled passengers who need to be accompanied. Information should be obtained from the relevant airline well in advance of the intended travel.Pre-existing illnessPeople suffering from underlying chronic illnesses should seek medical advice before planning a journey. Conditions that increase health risks during travel include:cardiovascular disorderschronic hepatitischronic inflammatory bowel diseasechronic renal disease requiring dialysischronic respiratory diseasesdiabetes mellitusepilepsyimmunosuppression due to medication or to HIV infectionprevious thromboembolic diseasesevere anaemiasevere mental disordersany chronic condition requiring frequent medical interventiontransplantationoncological conditionschronic haematological conditions.Travellers with a chronic illness should carry all necessary medication and medical items for the entire duration of the journey. All medications, especially prescription medications, should be packed in carry-on luggage, in their original containers with clear labels. A duplicate supply carried in the checked luggage is a safety precaution against loss or theft. With heightened airline security, sharp objects and liquids in quantities of more than 100 ml will have to remain in checked luggage.Travellers should carry the name and contact details of their physician on their person with other travel documents, together with information about the medical condition and treatment, and details of medication (generic drug names included) and prescribed doses. This information should also be stored electronically for remote retrieval, e.g. on a secure database.

Travellers should be aware that medical care abroad is often available only at private medical facilities and may be costly. In places where good-quality medical care is not readily available, travellers may need to be evacuated in case of accident or illness. If death occurs abroad, repatriation of the body can be extremely expensive and may be difficult to arrange. Travellers are advised (i) to seek information about possible reciprocal health-care agreements between the country of residence and the destination country, and (ii) to obtain comprehensive travellers’ health insurance for destinations where health risks are significant and medical care is expensive or not readily available. This health insurance should include coverage for changes to the itinerary, emergency evacuation for health reasons, hospitalization, medical care in case of illness or accident and repatriation of the body in case of death. Travellers should discuss with the parties concerned any issues or claims as they happen and not upon return from the trip.Travel agents and tour operators usually provide information about travellers’ health insurance and should advise travellers about the importance and benefits of travel insurance. It should be noted that some countries now require proof of adequate health insurance as a condition for entry. Moreover, some travel insurers require proof of immunizations and/or malaria prophylaxis as a condition of their approval for treatment or repatriation.

86ed1e5f-6eff-41b1-9862-d5df5582f0b3,What if I require a blood transfusion while travelling?,"Blood transfusion is a life-saving intervention. When used correctly, it saves lives and improves health. However, blood transfusion carries a potential risk of acute or delayed reactions and transfusion-transmissible infections and should be prescribed only to treat conditions associated with significant morbidity that cannot be prevented or managed effectively by other means.For travellers, the need for a blood transfusion almost always arises as a result of a medical emergency involving sudden massive blood loss, such as:accidental injury, such as road traffic accidentgynaecological or obstetric emergencysevere gastrointestinal haemorrhageemergency surgery.The safety of blood and blood products depends on the following key factors:A supply of safe blood and blood products through the careful selection of voluntary unpaid blood donors from low-risk populations who donate regularly, testing all donated blood for transfusion-transmissible infections, and correct storage and transportation at all stages from collection to transfusion within an adequate quality system.Appropriate prescription (only when there is no other remedy), proper cross-matching between the blood unit and the recipient, and safe administration of the blood or blood product at the bedside, with correct patient identification.In many countries, safe blood and blood products may not be available in all health care facilities. In addition, evidence from every region of the world indicates considerable variations in patterns of clinical blood use between different hospitals, different clinical specialities and even between different clinicians within the same speciality. This suggests that blood and blood products are often transfused unnecessarily.While blood transfusions given correctly save millions of lives every year, unsafe blood transfusions – as a result of the incompatibility of the blood, the volume transfused or the transmission of infections such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), HIV, malaria, syphilis or Chagas disease – can lead to serious reactions in the recipients.The initial management of major haemorrhage is the prevention of further blood loss and restoration of the blood volume as rapidly as possible in order to maintain tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This requires infusing the patient with large volumes of replacement fluids until the haemorrhage can be controlled. Some patients respond quickly and remain stable following the infusion of crystalloids or colloids and may not require blood transfusion.In malaria-endemic areas, there is a high risk of acquiring malaria from transfusion. It may be necessary to administer the routine treatment for malaria to the transfused patients.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling

Those on treatment of anaemia should carry and take required medications to avoid worsening of anaemia.Travellers with chronic medical conditions such as thalassaemia or haemophilia, which may necessitate regular transfusion of blood or plasma-derived products, should obtain medical advice on the management of their condition before travelling. They should also identify appropriate medical facilities at their travel destination and carry a supply of the relevant safe products with them, if appropriate.Travellers should take all possible precautions to avoid involvement in traffic accidents or other accidental injuries. They should also obtain a contact address at the travel destination, in advance, for advice and assistance in case of medical emergency.It is advised that travellers discuss with an attending physician on the use of alternatives to transfusion, if the need arises.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling
6a5d05d6-0f62-4a70-8aac-76ae0ea15b33,When if I am accidentally exposed to blood or other body fluids when travelling?,"Exposure to bloodborne pathogens may occur in case of:contact between blood or body fluids and a non-intact skin or with mucous membranes; andpercutaneous injury with needles or sharp instruments contaminated with blood or body fluids.These exposures may occur:when using syringes and needles that are not sterile or that have already been used and may therefore be contaminated with blood or body fluids even if this is not visible to the naked eye;as a result of accidents or acts of violence, including sexual assaults;in case of sexual exposure if no condom was used, or if the condom was broken;as occupational exposure, within and outside health care settings, to health care and other workers (such as rescuers, police officers) in the course of the work or to patients; andduring natural or human-made disasters.Accidental exposure may lead to infection by bloodborne pathogens, particularly HBV, HCV and HIV. The average risk of seroconversion after a single percutaneous exposure to infected blood is approximately 2% for HCV and 6–60% for HBV. For HIV, the average risk of seroconversion after a single percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood is 0.1–0.3%.Pre-exposure vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccination can be given before exposure to protect travellers from HBV infection. There are no vaccines for HCV or HIV.Post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an emergency medical response given as soon as possible after potential exposure to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens.

In some instances, disease can be prevented by vaccination, but there are some infectious diseases, including some of the most important and most dangerous, for which no vaccines exist.General precautions can greatly reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents and should always be taken for visits to any destination where there is a significant risk of exposure, regardless of whether any vaccinations or medication have been administered.Modes of transmission and general precautionsThe modes of transmission for different infectious diseases and the corresponding general precautions are outlined in the following paragraphs.foodborne and waterborne diseasesvector-borne diseaseszoonoses (diseases transmitted by animals)sexually transmitted diseasesbloodborne diseasesairborne diseasesdiseases transmitted via soil.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling
cfa26269-6f45-44f2-814d-b1f118750254,Is there a higher risk of road traffic accidents when travelling?,"Road traffic collisions are the most frequent cause of death among travellers. The risks associated with road traffic collisions and violence are greatest in low- and middle-income countries, where trauma care systems may not be well developed.Worldwide, an estimated 1.2 million people are killed each year in road traffic crashes and as many as 50 million more are injured. Projections indicate that road traffic fatalities will be the fifth leading cause of death by the year 2030 unless urgent action is taken to address the issue.In many low- and middle-income countries, traffic laws are inadequately enforced. The traffic mix is often more complex than that in high-income countries and involves two-, three- and four-wheeled vehicles, animal-drawn vehicles and other conveyances, plus pedestrians, all sharing the same road space. The roads may be poorly constructed and maintained, road signs and lighting inadequate and driving habits poor. Travellers, both drivers and pedestrians, should be extremely attentive and careful on the roads.There are a number of practical precautions that travellers can take to reduce the risk of being involved in, or becoming the victim of, a road traffic collision.PrecautionsObtain information on the regulations governing traffic and vehicle maintenance, and on the state of the roads, in the countries to be visited.Before renting a car check the state of its tyres, seat belts, spare wheels, lights, brakes, etc.Know the informal rules of the road; in some countries, for example, it is customary to sound the horn or flash the headlights before overtaking.Be particularly vigilant in a country where the traffic drives on the opposite side of the road to that used in your country of residence.Do not drive after drinking alcohol.Drive within the speed limit at all times.Always wear a seat-belt where these are available.Do not drive on unfamiliar and unlit roads.Do not use a moped, motorcycle, bicycle or tricycle.Beware of wandering animals.In addition, travellers driving vehicles abroad should make sure that they carry their personal driving licence as well as an international driving permit and that they have full insurance cover for medical treatment of injuries.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling
cdc00638-8db7-4c80-8652-9945f4568309,What are the risks of swimming or water sports when travelling?,"The hazards associated with swimming and recreational water sports can be minimized by safe behaviour and simple precautions.The most important health hazards in recreational waters are drowning and impact injuries, particularly head and spinal injuries. It is estimated that more than 300 000 deaths are caused by drowning every year. In addition, many more cases of non-fatal drowning occur, often with lifelong effects on health.Drowning may occur when an individual is caught in a tide or rip current, is trapped by rising tides, falls overboard from a boat, becomes trapped by submerged obstacles, or falls asleep on an inflatable mattress and is carried out to sea. In swimming pools and spas, drowning or near drowning and other injuries may occur close to outlets where suction is strong enough to catch body parts or hair so that the head is trapped under water. Drowning in swimming pools may be related to slip–trip–fall incidents leading to loss of consciousness on impact. If the water is not clear it may be difficult to see submerged swimmers or obstacles, increasing the chances of an accident in the water.Children can drown in a very short time and in a relatively small amount of water. The factor that contributes most frequently to children drowning is lack of adult supervision. Children in or near water should be constantly supervised by adults.Drowning is also a hazard for those wading and fishing. Falling into cold water, particularly when wearing heavy clothing, may result in drowning as swimming ability is hampered.Impact injuries are usually the result of diving accidents, particularly diving into shallow water and/or hitting underwater obstructions. Water may appear to be deeper than it is. Impact of the head on a hard surface may cause head and/ or spinal injuries. Spinal injuries may result in various degrees of paraplegia or quadriplegia. Head injuries may also cause concussion and loss of memory and/ or motor skills.Drowning and impact injuries in adults are frequently associated with alcohol consumption, which impairs judgement and the ability to react effectively.A detached retina, which can result in blindness or near-blindness, may be caused by jumping into water or jumping onto other people in the water.PrecautionsAdopt safe behaviour in all recreational waters: use life jackets where appropriate, pay attention to, and seek information from local residents regarding, tides and currents, and avoid outlets in spas and swimming pools.Ensure constant adult supervision of children in or near recreational waters, including small volumes of water.Avoid consumption of alcohol before any activity in or near water.Check the depth of the water carefully before diving, and avoid diving or jumping into murky water as submerged swimmers or objects may not be visible.Do not jump into water or jump onto others in the water.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling
a71402e3-bc66-4071-bc28-028e04c77f06,How can I prevent violence against me when travelling?,"Interpersonal violence is a significant risk in many low-and middle-income countries. Of the approximately 600 000 murders each year, more than 90% occur in low- and middle-income countries. For every murder, scores of people sustain non-fatal injuries requiring medical attention, and hundreds experience more insidious forms of violence and abuse leading to long-term physical and mental health consequences, behavioural disorders and social problems. While there are no epidemiological studies to date that examine how travelling for holiday purposes may increase or reduce involvement in violence, there is emerging evidence to show how it substantially increases known risk factors for violence, including alcohol and illicit drug use among young adults.PrecautionsModerate consumption of alcohol and avoid illicit drugs.Avoid becoming involved in verbal arguments that could escalate into physical fighting.Leave the scene if you feel threatened by the mood and tone set by other people’s behaviour.Avoid going to someone else’s private home or hotel room until you know them well.Be alert to the possibility of muggings during the day as well as at night.Keep jewellery, cameras and other items of value out of sight and do not carry large sums of money on your person.Avoid isolated beaches and other remote areas.Use taxis from authorized ranks only.Avoid driving at night and never travel alone.Keep car doors locked and windows shut.Be particularly alert when waiting at traffic lights.Park in well-lit areas and do not pick up strangers.Employ the services of a local guide/interpreter or local driver when travelling to remote areas.Vehicle hijacking is a recognized risk in a number of countries.

063d52cc-a982-4e66-bf8c-e87408c295e3,Is the risk to mental health increased when travelling?,"International travel is often a stressful experience. Travellers face separation from family and familiar social support systems and must deal with the impact of foreign cultures and languages, as well as bewildering, unfamiliar threats to health and safety. Coping with high levels of stress may result in physical, social and psychological problems. Those who encounter a greater range of stress factors may be at greater risk for psychological problems. Under the stress of travel, pre-existing mental disorders can be exacerbated. Furthermore, for those people with a predisposition towards mental disorder, such a disorder may emerge for the first time during travel.Physicians caring for people in their home countries or overseas should be aware of the differences (both within and between countries) in the availability of mental health resources (for example, emergency facilities, staff, beds and investigative facilities) as well as in the type and quality of medication. Culturally compatible clinicians and support staff may be rare or non-existent, and they may not understand the native language of the traveller, so access to interpreters may be necessary. The legal environment within which a clinician practises may also vary widely. Laws dealing with the use of illicit substances vary considerably and penalties may, in some countries, be quite severe. As a result of these differences in the infrastructure for providing mental health care and in legal systems, the first decision a clinician may have to make is whether the traveller’s care can be managed at the travel destination or whether the traveller requires repatriation.While managing mental disorders, health care providers should remain aware of – and ensure protection of, and respect for – the rights of people with mental disorders, in keeping with international covenants and national laws. This should include informing individuals about their rights regarding their treatment, their health condition and treatment options, and obtaining consent for all diagnostic and treatment interventions as appropriate.Mental disorders are not rare among travellers. Overall, mental health issues are among the leading causes of ill health among travellers, and psychiatric emergency is one of the most common medical reasons for air evacuation, along with injury and cardiovascular disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling
d6fde39e-2285-4cec-bd02-6e3e016626b4,How can I reduce risks to mental health when travelling?,"Although some of the events that cause stress cannot be predicted, taking precautions may reduce travel-related stress. Travellers should gather proper information before travel (for example, on the nature of their journey, such as the mode of travel or the journey length, or on the characteristics of their destination and the expected difficulties); this will enable them to maintain their self-confidence and to cope with the unfamiliar. It also allows them to develop strategies to minimize risks. Gathering information before travel helps to reduce the risk of suffering psychological disturbances or aggravating a pre-existing mental disorder.Neuropsychiatric disturbances (seizures, psychosis and encephalopathy) occur in approximately 1 in 10 000 travellers receiving mefloquine prophylaxis for malaria. Patients with a recent history of neuropsychiatric disorder, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, or psychotic or seizure disorder, should be prescribed an alternative regimen.Travellers subject to stress and anxiety, especially concerning air travel, should be helped to develop coping mechanisms. Individuals who are afraid of flying may be referred to specialized courses run by airlines, if available.Given the potential consequences of a psychiatric emergency arising while travelling overseas, enquiry into psychiatric history or treatment should be a standard part of any pre-travel consultation. Travellers with a significant history of mental disorder should receive specific medical and psychological advice. Those using psychotropic medication should continue the medication while travelling. In certain countries it is a criminal offence to carry a prescription psychotropic medication (for example, benzodiazepine) without proof of prescription. It is thus highly advisable that travellers carry a letter from a physician certifying the need for drugs or other medical items, or both, as well as documents about their clinical conditions and details about treatment, such as copies of prescriptions. All these documents should be ideally in a language that is understood in the country of travel. Travellers who will be abroad for long periods of time (for example, expatriates or business travellers) can be taught self-monitoring techniques and stress-reduction strategies before departure or during their stay. If drug misuse is suspected, the large variation in the legal status of drug misuse among countries should be emphasized.If the appropriate precautions are taken, most people affected by a mental disorder whose condition is stable and who are under the supervision of a medical specialist are able to travel abroad.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-risks-when-traveling
96012af2-5e43-483f-954c-d7592b0aa0eb,Is it safe to travel by air while pregnant or with a newborn baby?,"Pregnant women can normally travel safely by air, but most airlines restrict travel in late pregnancy. Typical guidelines for a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy are:after the 28th week of pregnancy, a letter from a doctor or midwife should be carried, confirming the expected date of delivery and that the pregnancy is normal;for single pregnancies, flying is permitted up to the end of the 36th week;for multiple pregnancies, flying is permitted up to the end of the 32nd week.Any case of a complicated pregnancy requires medical clearance.A fit and healthy baby can travel by air 48 hours after birth, but it is preferable to wait until the age of 7 days. Until their organs have developed properly and stabilized, premature babies should always undergo a medical clearance before travelling by air. Changes in cabin air pressure may upset infants, and this can be helped by feeding or giving a pacifier to stimulate swallowing.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice
8fcc6148-5638-47c0-91b0-01a0c0b60d23,Are long-distance flights dangerous because of immobility and deep vein thrombosis?,"The contraction of muscles is an important factor in helping to keep blood flowing through the veins, particularly in the legs. Prolonged immobility, especially when seated, can lead to pooling of blood in the legs, which in turn may cause swelling, stiffness and discomfort.It is known that immobility is one of the factors that may lead to the development of a blood clot in a deep vein, known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Research has shown that DVT can occur as a result of prolonged immobility, for instance during long-distance travel, whether by car, bus, train or air. A WHO study showed that the risk of DVT increased 2- to 3-fold after long-haul flights of more than 4 hours and similar forms of travel.In most cases of DVT, the body is able to gradually break down the clots and there are no long-term effects. Larger clots may cause symptoms such as swelling of the leg, tenderness, soreness and pain. Occasionally a piece of a clot may break off and travel with the bloodstream, to become lodged in the lungs. This is known as pulmonary embolism and may cause chest pain, shortness of breath and, in severe cases, sudden death. This can occur many hours or even days after the formation of the clot in the leg.The risk of developing DVT when travelling is increased in the presence of other risk factors, including:previous DVT or pulmonary embolismhistory of DVT or pulmonary embolism in a close family memberuse of oestrogen therapy – oral contraceptives (known as the pill) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)pregnancyrecent surgery or trauma, particularly to the abdomen, pelvic region or legscancerobesitysome inherited blood-clotting abnormalities.DVT occurs more commonly in older people. Some researchers have suggested that there may be a risk from smoking and from varicose veins.It is advisable for people with one or more of these risk factors to seek specific medical advice from their doctor or a travel medicine clinic in good time before embarking on a flight of 4 or more hours.WHO suggests moving around the cabin during long flights to reduce prolonged immobility, although this may not always be possible. A regular trip to the bathroom, for example every 2–3 hours, is a reasonable measure. Many airlines provide helpful advice on exercises that can be carried out in the seat during flight. Exercise of the calf muscles can stimulate the circulation, alleviate discomfort, fatigue and stiffness, and may reduce the risk of developing DVT. WHO also suggests that hand luggage should not be placed where it restricts movement of the legs and feet, and clothing should be loose and comfortable.In view of the clear risk of significant side effects and absence of clear evidence of benefit, passengers are advised not to use aspirin specifically for the prevention of travel related DVT. Travellers at greatest risk of developing DVT may be prescribed specific treatments and should consult their doctor for further advice.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice

The equipment carried varies, with many airlines carrying more than the minimum level of equipment required by regulations. Equipment carried on a typical international flight would include:one or more first-aid kits, to be used by the crew;a medical kit, normally to be used by a doctor or other qualified person, to treat in-flight medical emergencies.An automated external defibrillator (AED), to be used by the crew in case of cardiac arrest, is also carried by several airlines.Cabin crew are trained in the use of first-aid equipment and in carrying out first-aid and resuscitation procedures. They are usually also trained to recognize a range of medical conditions that may cause emergencies on board and to act appropriately to manage these.In addition, many airlines have facilities to enable crew to contact a medical expert at a ground-based response centre for advice on how to manage in-flight medical emergencies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice

Is it safe for me to travel by air?,"Most people with medical conditions are able to travel safely by air, provided that necessary precautions, such as the need for additional oxygen supply, are considered in advance.Those who have underlying health problems such as cancer, heart or lung disease, anaemia and diabetes, who are on any form of regular medication or treatment, who have recently had surgery or been in hospital, or who are concerned about their fitness to travel for any other reason should consult their doctor or a travel medicine clinic before deciding to travel by air.Medication that may be required during the journey, or soon after arrival, should be carried in the hand luggage. It is also advisable to carry a copy of the prescription in case the medication is lost, additional supplies are needed or security checks require proof of purpose.A frequent traveller who has a permanent and stable underlying health problem may obtain a frequent traveller’s medical card (or equivalent) from the medical or reservation department of many airlines.

However, unfinished root canal treatment and dental abscesses are reasons for caution, and it is recommended that individuals seek advice from their dental practitioner before making travel plans.Security issuesSecurity checks can cause concerns for travellers who have been fitted with metal devices such as artificial joints, pacemakers or internal automatic defibrillators. Some pacemakers may be affected by modern security screening equipment and any traveller with a pacemaker should carry a letter from their doctor.SmokersAlmost all airlines now ban smoking on board. Some smokers may find this stressful, particularly during long flights, and should discuss the issue with a doctor before travelling.

A passenger who is unable to look after his or her own needs during the flight (including use of the toilet and transfer from wheelchair to seat and vice versa) will need to be accompanied by an escort able to provide all necessary assistance. The cabin crew are generally not permitted to provide such assistance and a traveller who requires it but does not have a suitable escort may not be permitted to travel. Travellers confined to wheelchairs should be advised against deliberately restricting fluid intake before or during travel as a means of avoiding use of the toilet during flights, as this may be detrimental to overall health.Airlines have regulations on conditions of travel for passengers with disabilities.

1ff46b07-2246-4e91-a0d4-b0b932303e64,Can I get sick from other passengers while flying?,"Research has shown that there is little risk of any communicable disease being transmitted on board an aircraft.The quality of aircraft cabin air is carefully controlled. Ventilation provides a total change of air 20–30 times per hour. Most modern aircraft have recirculation systems, which recycle up to 50% of cabin air. The recirculated air is usually passed through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters of the type used in hospital operating theatres and intensive care units, which trap dust particles, bacteria, fungi and viruses.Transmission of infection may occur between passengers who are seated in the same area of an aircraft, usually as a result of the infected individual coughing or sneezing or by touch (direct contact or surfaces that other passengers touch). This is no different from any other situation in which people are close to each other, such as on a train or bus or in a theatre. Highly contagious conditions, such as influenza, are more likely to be spread to other passengers in situations where the aircraft ventilation system is not operating.To minimize the risk of passing on infections, travellers who are unwell, particularly if they have a fever, should delay their journey until they have recovered. Individuals with a known active communicable disease should not travel by air. Airlines may deny boarding to passengers who appear to be infected with a communicable disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice

6536679f-14ab-4305-bafb-99a2539ed2f3,Is cabin air pressure dangerous to passengers?,"Although aircraft cabins are pressurized, cabin air pressure at cruising altitude is lower than air pressure at sea level. At typical cruising altitudes in the range 11 000–12 200 m (36 000–40 000 feet), air pressure in the cabin is equivalent to the outside air pressure at 1800–2400 m (6000–8000 feet) above sea level. As a consequence, less oxygen is taken up by the blood (hypoxia) and gases within the body expand. The effects of reduced cabin air pressure are usually well tolerated by healthy passengers.Passengers with certain medical conditions, particularly heart and lung diseases and blood disorders such as anaemia (in particular sickle-cell anaemia), may not tolerate this reduced oxygen level (hypoxia) very well. Some of these passengers are able to travel safely if arrangements are made with the airline for the provision of an additional oxygen supply during flight. However, because regulations and practices differ from country to country and between airlines, it is strongly recommended that these travellers, especially those wishing to carry their own oxygen, contact the airline early in their travel plans. An additional charge is often levied on passengers who require supplemental oxygen to be provided by the airline.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice
26f432f0-1333-4895-8c6a-21a8016f62d5,What is jet lag and how can I avoid it?,"Jet lag is the term used for the symptoms caused by the disruption of the body’s internal clock and the circadian rhythms it controls. This happens when crossing multiple time zones, i.e. when flying east to west or west to east. Jet lag may lead to indigestion and disturbance of bowel function, general malaise, daytime sleepiness, difficulty in sleeping at night, and reduced physical and mental performance. Its effects are often combined with tiredness caused by the journey itself. Jet lag symptoms gradually wear off as the body adapts to the new time zone.Travellers who take medication according to a strict timetable (e.g. insulin or oral contraceptives) should seek medical advice from their doctor or a travel medicine clinic before their journey.Jet lag cannot be prevented but there are ways of reducing its effects:Be as well rested as possible before departure and use any opportunity to rest during medium to long-haul flights. Even short naps (less than 40 min) can be helpful.Eat light meals and limit consumption of alcohol. Caffeine should be limited to normal amounts and avoided within 4–6 hours of an expected period of sleep.Get a normal amount of sleep in the 24 hours after arrival. A minimum block of 4 hours sleep during the local night – known as anchor sleep – is thought to be necessary to allow the body’s internal clock to adapt to the new time zone. If possible, make up the total sleep time by taking naps during the day in response to feelings of sleepiness.The cycle of light and dark is one of the most important factors in setting the body’s internal clock. A well-timed exposure to daylight, preferably bright sunlight, at the destination will usually help adaptation.Short-acting sleeping pills may be helpful. They should be used only in accordance with medical advice and should not normally be taken during the flight, as they may increase immobility and therefore the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.Melatonin is available in some countries. It is normally sold as a food supplement and therefore is not subject to the same strict control as medications. The timing and effective dosage of melatonin have not been fully evaluated and its side-effects, particularly in long-term use, are unknown. Moreover, manufacturing methods are not standardized: the dose per tablet can vary considerably and some harmful compounds may be present. For these reasons, melatonin cannot be recommended.Trying to adjust to local time for short trips of up to 2–3 days may not be the best coping strategy because the body’s clock may not have an opportunity to synchronize to the new time zone and re-synchronization to the home time zone may be delayed after the return flight. If in doubt, seek specialist travel medicine advice.Individuals react in different ways to time zone changes. Frequent flyers should learn how their own bodies respond and adopt habits accordingly. Advice from a travel medicine clinic may help in formulating an effective coping strategy.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice
16a24330-6eb0-4636-8778-8a8004963192,My ears and sinuses feel strange when I fly. How can I fix this?,"Passengers often experience a popping sensation in the ears caused by air escaping from the middle ear and the sinuses during the aircraft’s climb. This is not usually considered a problem. As the aircraft descends in altitude prior to landing, air must flow back into the middle ear and sinuses in order to equalize pressure. If this does not happen, the ears or sinuses may feel as if they are blocked and pain can result. Swallowing, chewing or yawning will usually relieve any discomfort. As soon as it is recognized that the problem will not resolve itself using these methods, a short forceful expiration against a pinched nose and closed mouth (called the Valsalva manoeuvre) should be tried and will usually help. For infants, feeding or giving a pacifier to stimulate swallowing may reduce the symptoms.Individuals with ear, nose and sinus infections should avoid flying because pain and injury may result from the inability to equalize pressure differences. If travel cannot be avoided, the use of decongestant nasal drops shortly before the flight and again before descent may be helpful.As the aircraft climbs, expansion of gas in the abdomen can cause discomfort, although this is usually mild.Some forms of surgery (e.g. abdominal surgery) and other medical treatments or tests (e.g. treatment for a detached retina) may introduce air or other gases into a body cavity. Travellers who have recently undergone such procedures should ask a travel medicine physician or their treating physician how long they should wait before undertaking air travel.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-travel-advice

Low humidity may cause skin dryness and discomfort to the eyes, mouth and nose but presents no risk to health. Use skin moisturizing lotion or a saline nasal spray to moisturize the nasal passages. Wearing eyeglasses rather than contact lenses can relieve or prevent discomfort to the eyes. Evidence has not shown low humidity to cause internal dehydration and there is no need to drink more than usual.

c9ccdb85-6345-41ed-854d-6681d8439d07,Should I be worried about ozone or cosmic radiation when flying?,"Neither ozone nor cosmic rays are dangerous to airline passengers or crew.Ozone is a form of oxygen that occurs in the upper atmosphere and may enter the aircraft cabin together with the fresh-air supply. In older aircraft, it was found that the levels of ozone in cabin air could sometimes lead to irritation of the lungs, eyes and nasal tissues. Ozone is broken down by heat and a significant amount of ozone is removed by the engine compressors (which compress and heat the air) that provide pressurized air for the cabin. In addition, most modern long-haul jet aircraft are fitted with equipment called catalytic converters that break down any remaining ozone.Cosmic radiation comes from the sun and from outer space. The Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are natural shields and cosmic radiation levels are therefore lower at lower altitudes. The Earth’s population is continually exposed to natural background radiation from soil, rock and building materials as well as from cosmic radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface.Cosmic radiation is more intense over polar regions than over the equator because of the shape of the Earth’s magnetic field and the flattening of the atmosphere over the poles.

This can include contaminated bunkered water, inadequate disinfection of water, potable water contaminated by sewage on the ship, poor design and construction of storage tanks for potable water, deficiencies in food handling, preparation and cooking, and use of seawater in the galley.Norovirus is the most common pathogen in these outbreaks. Symptoms often start with the sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea. There may be fever, abdominal cramps and malaise. The virus can spread in food or water or from person to person; it is highly infectious and in an outbreak on a cruise ship, more than 80% of the passengers can be affected. To prevent or reduce outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus, ships are enhancing food and water sanitation measures and disinfection of surfaces. More ships are providing hand gel dispensers at strategic locations throughout the ship and passengers and crew are urged to use them. Some cruise companies ask that those who experience gastrointestinal symptoms at on-board medical centres be put into isolation until at least 24 hours after their last symptoms, and some ships also isolate people in contact with those with symptoms for 24 hours, even if they do not themselves show signs of infection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/sea-travel-advice

The disease is normally contracted by inhaling Legionella bacteria deep into the lungs. Legionella species can be found in tiny droplets of water (aerosols) or in droplet nuclei (the particles left after water has evaporated). More than 50 incidents of legionellosis, involving over 200 cases, have been associated with ships during the past three decades. For example, an outbreak of legionellosis occurring on a cruise ship in 1994, resulted in 50 passengers on nine other cruises becoming infected, with one death. The disease was linked to a whirlpool spa on the ship. Other sources have been potable water supplies and exposure during port layovers.Prevention and control depend on proper disinfection, filtration and storage of source water, and on designing piping systems without dead ends.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 disease has been transmitted in all regions of the world, from cold and dry, to hot and humid climates.SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted directly from person-to-person through close contact, or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People may be infected by touching exposed surfaces, but this is not thought to be a major transmission route. While temperature and humidity may influence how long the virus survives outside of the human body, this effect is likely to be small compared to the degree of contact between people.Physical distancing and washing hands are therefore essential to breaking the chain of transmission, and are the most effective way to protect yourself, in all locations and all seasons of the year.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change

As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in wildlife, and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence.

It kills approximately 7 million people every year and is responsible for one third of all deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Over 90% of the global population lives in places where the WHO outdoor air quality guideline levels are not met, and about two-thirds of this exposure is caused by burning of fossil fuels, which also drives climate change.Efforts to control COVID-19 transmission have reduced economic activity and led to temporary improvements in air quality in some areas.

Climate change is a gradually increasing stress that may be the defining public health threat of the 21st century. Nonetheless, common lessons can be drawn:Ensuring universal health coverage (UHC), through well-resourced, equitable health systems, is essential to protect the public from both short and long-term health threats.Guaranteeing global health security requires an all-hazards approach to preparedness, from infectious disease outbreaks, to extreme weather events, to climate change.  Ensuring access to the environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, water and sanitation, safe and nutritious food, is an essential protection against all health risks. WHO estimates that avoidable environmental risks cause about a quarter of the global health burden.Early action saves lives. Delay in responding to clear evidence of threats, whether from pandemics, or from climate change, increases human and socioeconomic costs. Inequality is a major barrier in ensuring health and wellbeing, especially for the most vulnerable in society. Social and economic inequality manifests in unequal health risks.

707626a7-d526-492c-8c09-fc66f5fafdd4,Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19?,"Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have
been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current
scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care
resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that
apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to
different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to
significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are
relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it
may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that
deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years.When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to
which resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, for
instance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example,
ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce,
though – when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocation
should be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there are
characteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevant
characteristics of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should play
no role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment to treating
people with equal respect.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting

ethical justifications in different principles or values. For instance, once a novel vaccine is
found to be safe and effective, to prioritize those at highest risk, as well as populations like
health care workers who may be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified.Within those subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may be
justified, given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits will be
derived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however, for other
resources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly more benefit

c595d111-2f76-4026-bd6e-6632a104de2f,What is the basis for deciding who should have priority access to scarce resources?,"The ethical basis for deciding which individuals or groups might be prioritized, including the principles to be applied, are presented in the below table:Ethical considerations when deciding who to prioritizePrincipleDescriptionPractice implicationEqualityEach person’s interest should count equally unless there are good reasons that justify the differential prioritization of resources.
Irrelevant characteristics of individuals, such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not serve arbitrarily as the basis for the differential allocation of resources.
This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery – that is, randomly by chance – or by a system of first come, first served. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals or populations who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource, for example, vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among
those with similar clinical indicators for benefit.Best outcomes (utility)This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity to do the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available resources to save the most lives possible.
May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources that confer substantially different benefits to different individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected to derive the most benefit.Prioritize the worst offThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those in greatest medical need or those most at risk.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources that are designed or intended to protect those at risk, for example, PPE for health care workers, vaccines for those most at risk of infection and severe illness, or those most
in need, as in the case of provision of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently.Prioritize those tasked with helping othersThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation in helping others.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources to health care workers, first responders, etc.Allocation principles may be relevant or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of resources such as ventilators may be most justified by the
principle of first come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity,
a principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified. At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality – that is, first come, first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individuals
within a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar needs, or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources, or among those that are at similar levels of risk).In addition, multiple principles may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helping
others, which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting
87d67b6e-87b0-40d2-9b68-b2376936f549,"How should decision-makers make considered ethical judgements about these matters, given the likelihood that there will not be enough of a resource? Who should be involved in decision-making on scarce resources?","For most decisions, multiple ethical values and principles will be relevant to deliberations
about how to allocate resources. This is likely to generate some disagreement, because
different people may weigh the values differently. Some may prioritize equality while others
might put more emphasis on best outcomes or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason,
it is imperative that the different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues
using a fair process.A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical values:Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should
be made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria
guiding the decisions.Inclusiveness. Those affected by allocation decisions – including individuals,
communities or countries – should be able to exert at least some influence over the
decision-making process as well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions
4
should be open to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appeal
process. Consistency. Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categories
are treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one’s own family,
religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of
corruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and
condemned. Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for
those decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for
them. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by
individuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation
between countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies
should not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.The fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because it is fair.
However, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders solidarity and trust,
which are vital to the successful and sustained collective response necessary for dealing
effectively with any outbreak.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting

Each government has special obligations to its own citizens, but the fair allocation of vaccines globally

d56be6bd-d7b2-4f36-a597-bc124b113da9,What conclusions can we draw about the fair allocation of scarce resources within countries during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"Health care workers (caring for patients) and first responders can justifiably be
prioritized when allocating some resources because of their contribution to the health
and well-being of the community. Their health helps preserve the health of others.Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical
resources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have
also helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority – for
example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the
case of resources such as vaccines.While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating
resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice,
it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre,
those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off.Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context.
Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, but
perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care
resources.The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different
principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective,
a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old and
those with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines.Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off:
centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits to
more people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for
those at highest risk.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting

The term malnutrition covers 2 broad groups of conditions. One is ‘undernutrition’—which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals). The other is overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer).

4f45b945-be49-49bc-9ae9-88dbc6099d80,How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?,"High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings
c95606f9-512d-4c5b-a0f0-3962fc54f949,Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings
8250451e-274c-4eb6-b314-8bf6f73c87b1,What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020.

504367ee-e0be-4c01-824b-b55cc8af6bd8,"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue.

Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings
8e9abf0c-e063-4b25-947a-a58d5ca2dd8f,Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)?,"Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings

1c47c73d-1f70-4551-9fc3-7127de5240b9,What is taeniasis and cysticercosis?,"Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by 3 species of tapeworm: Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and Taenia asiatica. Humans can become infected with T. saginata or T. asiatica when they consume infected beef meat or pig liver tissue, respectively, which has not been adequately cooked, but taeniasis due to T. saginata or T. asiatica has no major impact on human health. Therefore, we refer here only to the transmission and health impacts of T. solium.
Infection with T. solium can result in two distinct conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis. While the adult tapeworm in the human intestine (taeniasis) does not have major health impacts, humans can also develop cysticercosis with tapeworm larvae (cysticerci) in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system, with possible devastating effects on health. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions and epileptic seizures and can be fatal.
Neurocysticercosis is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide, and is estimated to cause 30% of all epilepsy cases in countries where the parasite is endemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis

It is common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces.

Once in the human body, cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms that live in the intestine and release egg-bearing gravid proglottids (segments) which are passed out with faeces.Cysticercosis is acquired when worm proglottids or eggs are ingested and the developing larvae migrate through the body and form cysts in tissues. This is the case in pigs and cattle but it can also affect humans, usually when they swallow T. solium egg-contaminated soil, water or food (mainly vegetables) or through self-infection when hygiene practices, such as hand washing after the toilet, are unsufficient.

31d68c3c-39f9-4a00-abc4-f03a59c316e4,What are the symptoms of the diseases?,"Taeniasis is usually characterized by mild and non-specific symptoms. Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation may arise when the tapeworms become fully developed in the intestine, 6–8 weeks after ingestion of the meat containing cysticerci. These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for years.For T. solium cysticercosis, the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions (particularly in Asia), infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node which is solid that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin (subcutaneous). These cysts are generally discovered by the host following spontaneous degeneration of the parasite or after treatment, where an inflammatory reaction may occur.Neurocysticercosis is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype, but it can also be clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous system.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis

Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).

How should I advise individuals who are using or want to use combined hormonal contraception?,"According to currently available evidence, most women of childbearing age with COVID-19 will likely be asymptomatic or have mild COVID-19 symptoms and should continue to take combined hormonal contraception (CHC). Here are the most common possible scenarios: Women who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms of known COVID-19: combined hormonal contraception can be continued and is considered safe in this population. If women are concerned, their provider should explain that there is no evidence of increased risk of thrombosis among combined hormonal contraception users with mild COVID-19 symptoms. If a combined hormonal contraception user wishes to discontinue this method, she can be offered a progestin-only or non-hormonal method, if available and acceptable. Women with serious symptoms[1] of COVID-19 who are not hospitalized: Discontinuation of combined hormonal contraception should be considered, based on a patient’s clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. immobilization for more than 7 days, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pneumonia). Considerations around stopping combined hormonal contraception should also take into account if the user has other medical conditions that may increase the risk of thrombosis during COVID-19. If combined hormonal contraception is discontinued, progestin-only or non-hormonal methods can be offered, if available and acceptable. Women hospitalized with severe COVID-19: Combined hormonal contraception should be discontinued during hospitalisation. The risk of thrombosis in this acutely ill population may outweigh the benefits of continuing combined hormonal contraception. Progestin-only and non-hormonal contraceptive methods can be used. Women resuming contraception: It is important that all women who discontinue contraception during COVID-19 illness are given counselling about when to resume contraception and are provided with the method of their choice. Any new or existing medical conditions need to be considered when choosing a contraceptive method. Combined hormonal contraception can be resumed 2 weeks after any prolonged period of prolonged limited mobility (immobilization). the end of immobilization. Other methods can be started without delay.  [1] Serious symptoms may include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement. Coronavirus.

These discharges can be spread by particular species of flies.In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with prevalence rates which can be as high as 60–90%. Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age.The disease thrives especially in crowded living conditions where there are shortages of water, inadequate sanitation and where numerous eye-seeking flies are present. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/trachoma

It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis.After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/trachoma

This includes careful examination and testing of the vaccine and its ingredients. These tests evaluate the safety of the vaccine, and how well it prevents a disease.If positive results are achieved in the lab, a manufacturer can then apply to do clinical trials. These trials typically involve several thousand healthy volunteers participants on a voluntary basis, whose safety is ensured by national regulatory authorities. The trials are bound by strict regulations and take place across three main phases:During Phase I, small groups (for instance, approximately 20-50 people) receive the vaccine. This phase will assess the safety, side effects, appropriate dosage, method of administration and composition of the vaccine.If it is successful, it will proceed to Phase II. At this stage, the vaccine is usually given to several hundred people. This group will have the same characteristics (e.g. age, sex) as the people for whom the vaccine is intended to be given.In Phase III, the vaccine is usually given to thousands of people to help ensure it is safe and effective for broader use.The results of all these studies will be assessed when regulators decide whether to approve a vaccine.

If necessary, detailed studies are conducted.During these investigations, it is extremely rare that health problems are found to be caused by the vaccine itself. Health events are most often found to be coincidental, i.e. entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes, they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported or administered (for instance, where errors are made in preparing the vaccine).

This catalysed the tobacco industry to revisit old tactics to restore its tarnished reputation
and secure a new generation of users. The tobacco industry has made well-researched, calculated attempts to redesign and rebrand its products to sustain profitability. It introduced cigarette filters and the so-called “light” and “mild” tobacco products as an alternative
to quitting, reducing tobacco users’ perceptions of risk and harm, and undermining effective tobacco control policies. Such misleading marketing continues today, with the industry advocating for the harm reduction approach
through new products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), commonly referred to as ‘e-cigarettes’, and heated tobacco products (HTPs).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations

These promotional strategies have the potential to renormalize smoking and drive long-term use of addictive nicotine
products which, like tobacco, are undoubtedly harmful to the consumer, under the guise of being a healthier alternative. Tobacco and related industries exploit the fact that the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes have not been established and
they are not yet regulated in most countries, enabling them to work around tobacco advertising bans and promote use of their products in smoke-free environments. Some manufacturers also tend to talk about e-cigarettes with HTPs together, thereby confusing potential consumers, and making it difficult to tell the difference between a tobacco and a non-tobacco product. These social-positioning techniques, coupled
with strategic marketing tactics, are particularly effective in targeting children and adolescents and have the potential to sustain nicotine addiction in youth globally.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations

Advertising is increasingly shifting to social media platforms, and the nicotine and tobacco industries are no different. “Influencers” on social media who reach and engage children
and adolescents are invited by these industries to serve as “brand ambassadors” or offered financial incentives to promote their products.  Social influencers have the potential to give their audiences the impression of more authentic
promotion of the products, particularly when posts do not disclose the sponsorship details.Scholarships. Tobacco and ENDS-related entities have offered scholarships to high school, college and graduate students, some requiring applicants to submit essays on the dangers of tobacco and the potential benefits
of ENDS use.School programmes and youth camps. Tobacco and

With the pervasiveness of smartphones and constant Internet access, nicotine and tobacco companies have strategically used digital and social media platforms to reach younger generations,
including through their favourite apps and video games. Social media platforms allow users to interact with the marketing features, which increases exposure and influence among children and adolescents. They also allow marketers
to access profile details of users and their friends and effectively target potential customers. Countries that have adopted advertising, promotion and sponsorship bans, but have not explicitly banned cross-border advertising, are
susceptible to exposing their youth to digital and social media advertising originating from other countries. Just over 100 hashtags associated with tobacco companies have been viewed more than 25 billion times around the world between 2007-2016.Attractive displays in retail shops. Vendors near schools are frequently paid to display nicotine and tobacco products in their retail shops, along with sleek point-of-sale display boards, attractive marketing materials and bright,

Young children are especially vulnerable: in 2018 alone, malaria claimed the lives of approximately 265 000 African children under the age of 5.*Over the last 2 decades, African countries have made tremendous progress in the fight against malaria using core WHO-recommended tools such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying with insecticides and antimalarial medicines. However, in some areas where these approaches have been adopted, malaria illness and death remain stubbornly high. New and complementary tools are needed to further drive down the disease burden, with a view to ultimately achieving the vision of a world free of malaria.Most malaria illness and death in the African region are caused by the parasite targeted by the RTS,S vaccine (P. falciparum). The vaccine was developed specifically for African children who are at highest risk of dying of malaria. Additional studies will be needed before the vaccine can be recommended for use outside Africa. * In 2018, children under 5 accounted for two thirds (67%) of global malaria deaths, the vast majority of which (approximately 265 000) were African children.

Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye).

programmatic conditions in South Africa. The current WHO recommendation is based on these data. Therefore, it is not
advised to further shorten the duration of the regimen. Likewise, changes to the regimen composition may have an
unpredictable impact on its effectiveness and are therefore not currently recommended to be implemented
programmatically. Medicines in the same class could, nevertheless be switched as follows:Prothionamide used instead of ethionamide;Moxifloxacin used instead of levofloxacin; andThe initial phase extended until 6 months if required; the duration of the continuation phase is fixed at 5
months.National TB programmes that intend to make any further modifications to the shorter all-oral bedaquiline-containing

and linezolid for more than two weeks. This regimen is not appropriate for programmatic use worldwide until additional
evidence on efficacy and safety has been generated. Nevertheless, in individual XDR-TB patients for whom the design of an

that is in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid. The data from Nix-TB study provided for the review by the GDG in
November 2019 also included the data on BPaL regimen and use of pretomanid in combination with two other medicines.
There is no currently available evidence on the use of Pa outside the BPaL regimen and it is therefore not included in the
priority grouping of TB medicines recommended by WHO. Although it is a nitroimidazole (i.e. in a similar class as delamanid)
it is a new chemical compound and cannot be used as a replacement for delamanid or added on its own to first- and

strategic planning, focused on issues such as drug forecasting and procurement should start immediately to enable rapid
transition to the upcoming new WHO recommendations. Phasing out injectables and replacing them with bedaquiline is
an urgent priority. National TB programmes will need to establish transition plans in agreement with relevant partners,

recommendations in their specific settings, including the choice of regimens based on current laboratory capacity for drug
susceptibility testing and background drug resistance patterns. Countries should also plan for the following:Inclusion of any products not previously used in the national Essential Medicines List;Ensuring that new products can be procured and imported (e.g. registration, import waivers);Identifying any funding gaps between the old and new guidelines and securing the necessary additional funds;Planning procurement of products with adequate lead times for procurement processes and for the products to

kanamycin or capreomycin) - is likely to require changes given the phasing out of injectables, anticipating patterns of
resistance that are more relevant to current and future regimens, and taking into account advances in diagnostic methods and drug susceptibility testing. Changes to the definition of XDR-TB will be the subject of future expert consultation and will
be included in revised WHO surveillance and reporting guides.Choosing appropriate regimens for patients with strains showing MDR-TB plus additional resistance to fluoroquinolones (so called “pre-XDR”) are increasingly becoming more important and feasible thanks to rapid advances in molecular drug susceptibility testing (see 2.5).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-key-changes-to-the-treatment-of-drug-resistant-tb
67d1a33a-9f7d-4d0c-a4fe-4cc41839b51b,How can resistance to the medicines in MDR-TB regimens be determined?,"The updated WHO guidelines will stress the importance of drug susceptibility testing (DST) prior to treatment, especially for
the medicines for which WHO-recommended rapid molecular tests are available. These include rifampicin, isoniazid and
quinolones. In addition, NTPs need to scale-up laboratory capacity for medicines for which there are accurate and
reproducible phenotypic methods, including bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine and delamanid.The WHO Supranational TB Reference Laboratories (SRL) Network is available to support national TB reference
laboratories in performing quality-assured DST. A WHO technical consultation in 2017 established critical concentrations
for susceptibility testing for the fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine and linezolid. Methods for testing
pretomanid susceptibility are currently under development.As in any potentially life-saving situation, treatment for drug-resistant TB should not be withheld from a patient due to a
lack of complete DST results. Even if available in some laboratories, phenotypic DST for cycloserine/terizidone,
ethambutol, imipenem-cilastatin/meropenem, ethionamide/prothionamide, and p-aminosalicylic acid is not
recommended for clinical decision making. Molecular DST methods such as sequencing are increasingly becoming
available at the national TB reference laboratory level and sequencing results can inform the development of
individualized regimens. Susceptibility to some of the medicines may in part be inferred from the results of molecular
testing using commercially available line probe assays (LPA)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-key-changes-to-the-treatment-of-drug-resistant-tb

very low at this point. Performing DST to bedaquiline and linezolid is therefore not essential before using these
medicines at this stage; however, national TB programmes are strongly advised to start building capacity for drug
resistance surveillance of these medicines. If resistance is suspected during treatment and DST is not available, the strains
should be conserved and referred to SRLs for further testing.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-key-changes-to-the-treatment-of-drug-resistant-tb

treatment. In addition to bacteriological investigations, several monitoring tests including electrocardiography (ECG),
clinical assessments for peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric disturbances, laboratory assessment of liver and kidney
function and blood profiles are necessary, based on the medications in use. Medicines with known risks for QT-interval
prolongation require ECG and monitoring of electrolytes, both at baseline and regularly during treatment. Details on

number of people currently on treatment, the latest data on consumption of medicines and current available stocks of
medicines. Programmes will need to know the number of people that are expected to be enrolled and make assumptions
on which treatment regimens will be used and the allocation between the different regimens. These assumptions should:Estimate the number of people that would qualify for a bedaquiline-based shorter regimen, the preferred initial
regimen for MDR/RR-TB. These estimates need to account for the current eligibility criteria for use of the shorter
regimen.The remaining number of people that would not qualify for the bedaquiline-based shorter-regimen and should
receive an individualized longer regimen based on the criteria set out in the most recent WHO Guidance on DRTB.If a programme is planning to introduce the BPaL regimen for the treatment of XDR under operational research
conditions, this should be estimated as well.Planning should be done by medicine for those receiving individualized regimens (and those that may move to an individualized regimen after starting the bedaquiline-based shorter regimen). When planning the composition of such
regimens NTPs need to consider patient history, DST profiles of the patient, local setting (the prevalence of different

23571d21-ca25-4851-b35e-a72818bd9998,How do I protect my health in a flood?,"Since floods can potentially increase the transmission of water- and vector-borne diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, among others, it is important to know your risk and protect your water sources. The most common risks associated with flooding is the contamination of drinking-water facilities, and standing water, which can be a breeding site for mosquitoes, bring chemical hazards, and cause injuries.
Protect your health during a flood by:

Knowing your community’s evacuation route and warning signals, and identifying areas prone to flooding or landslides.
Chlorinating or boiling all water for drinking and food preparation
Ensuring uninterrupted provision of safe drinking water is the most important preventive measure to be implemented following flooding, in order to reduce the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases.

Promoting good hygienic practices and safe food preparation techniques
Do not use flood water to wash dishes, brush teeth or wash and prepare food. Always wash your hands with soap and water if you have been in contact with floodwater.
Avoiding walking or driving through flooded areas and standing water.
Even the smallest amount of water can bring about significant dangers. You do not know if electrical lines have fallen in the water or hazardous chemicals exist. Cars and people can easily be swept away during a flood.

Throwing away any food that has come in contact with floodwater.
If your food has touched any floodwater, it is not safe to eat and increases your risk of water-borne diseases.

Safely cleaning your home if it has come in contact with floodwater.
Throw out any items that cannot be washed and cleaned with bleach, such as pillows and mattresses. Clean all walls, floors and other surfaces with soap and water, as well as bleach.

Protect against mosquitos
If your home is in an area with stagnant or standing water, use mosquito repellent, following the instructions on the label, and apply it to clothes or skin. Also wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, and cover beds with mosquito nets when sleeping.

dc3d5a55-aeea-48c9-92e1-6a309a4a0e04,What is universal health coverage?,"The goal of universal health coverage is to ensure that all
people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial
hardship when paying for them. For a community or country to achieve universal health coverage, several factors must be in place, including:A strong, efficient, well-run health system that meets priority
health needs through people-centred integrated care (including services
for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, noncommunicable diseases, maternal and
child health) by: informing and encouraging people to stay healthy and prevent illness;detecting health conditions early;having the capacity to treat disease; andhelping patients with rehabilitation. Affordability – a system for financing health services so people
do not suffer financial hardship when using them. This can be achieved
in a variety of ways. Access to essential medicines and technologies to diagnose and treat medical problems.A sufficient capacity of well-trained, motivated health workers
to provide the services to meet patients’ needs based on the best
available evidence. It also requires recognition of the critical role played by
all sectors in assuring human health, including transport, education and
urban planning.Universal health coverage has a direct impact on a
population’s health. Access to health services enables people to be
more productive and active contributors to their families and
communities. It also ensures that children can go to school and learn.
At the same time, financial risk protection prevents people from being
pushed into poverty when they have to pay for health services out of
their own pockets. Universal health coverage is thus a critical
component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key
element of any effort to reduce social inequities. Universal coverage is
the hallmark of a government’s commitment to improve the wellbeing of
all its citizens. Universal coverage is firmly based on the WHO constitution of
1948 declaring health a fundamental human right and on the Health for
All agenda set by the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978. Equity is paramount.
This means that countries need to track progress not just across the
national population but within different groups (e.g. by income level,
sex, age, place of residence, migrant status and ethnic origin).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/what-is-universal-health-coverage

76d0e15b-40a5-429a-b7b8-9b2f55214c09,How can violence against children be prevented?,"There are two distinct types of violence experienced by
children (defined by the United Nations as anyone aged 0-18 years) -
child maltreatment by parents and caregivers in children aged 0-14, and
violence occurring in community settings among adolescents aged 15-18
years. These different types of violence can be prevented by addressing
the underlying causes and risk factors specific to each type.
Child maltreatment by parents and caregivers can be prevented by:reducing unintended pregnancies; reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy;reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use by new parents;improving access to high quality pre- and post-natal services; providing home visitation services by professional nurses and
social workers to families where children are at high-risk of
maltreatment;providing training for parents on child development, non-violent discipline and problem-solving skills.Violence involving children in community settings can be prevented through:pre-school enrichment programmes to give young children an educational head start; life skills training;assisting high-risk adolescents to complete schooling;reducing alcohol availability through the enactment and enforcement of liquor licensing laws, taxation and pricing;restricting access to firearms.Improving the efficiency of pre-hospital and emergency medical
care will reduce the risk of death, the time for recovery and the
level of long-term impairment due to violence. All violence against children and especially child
maltreatment occurring in the first decade of life is both a problem in
itself and a major risk factor for other forms of violence and health
problems through a person's life. For instance, a WHO study estimated
that the lifetime impact of child sexual abuse accounts for
approximately 6% of cases of depression, 6% of alcohol and drug
abuse/dependence, 8% of suicide attempts, 10% of panic disorders and 27%
of post traumatic stress disorders. Other studies have also linked
child physical abuse, sexual abuse and other childhood adversities to
excessive smoking, eating disorders, and high-risk sexual behaviour,
which in turn are associated with some of the leading causes of death
including cancers and cardiovascular disorders.WHO supports countries to collect data and information related
to violence against children, develop national violence prevention
policies and programmes, and create systems for the provision of
appropriate medico-legal and emergency trauma care.Related linksChild maltreatment preventionTogether for girls: sexual violence against girlsUNICEF Child ProtectionSpecial Representatives of the United Nations Secretary General on Violence against Children",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/violence-against-children-how-can-it-be-prevented

humanitarian emergencies. Young children in emergencies face higher
risks of diarrhoea, pneumonia and undernutrition. Lack of food, unsafe
water, poor sanitation, overcrowding and overburdened health systems put
infants and young children at greater risk.

redeployed to cope with other aspects of the emergency response.
Well-meaning donors may distribute breast-milk substitutes

UTN numbers may be issued for previously registered trials.In order to avoid duplication of records and permit accurate
record bridging on the ICTRP, it is strongly suggested that only the
coordinating centre apply for the UTN. Once the UTN has been assigned,
the coordinating centre should update all records within primary
registers and on all other documentation (e.g., ethical review committee
submissions, letters, etc) to reflect the UTN.Remember a trial, no matter how many sites should have only one UTN.Circumstances where retrospective UTN applications may be considered are:proposal, registered (not yet enrolling)trial registered and enrolment terminatedtrial registered, still enrolling, no new sitestrial registered, still enrolling, adding a new siteAs the primary purpose of the UTN is to identify a trial

states that ""Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject"".Improving awareness of similar or identical trials will make it
possible for researchers and funding agencies to avoid unnecessary
duplication.Describing clinical trials in progress can make it easier to identify gaps in clinical trials research.Making researchers and potential participants aware of recruiting trials may facilitate recruitment.Enabling researchers and health care practitioners to identify
trials in which they may have an interest could result in more effective
collaboration among researchers. The type of collaboration may include prospective meta-analysis.Registries checking data as part of the registration process may

Searching the complete database of registered records by keywords remains problematic. Indeed, there are risks of having false positives but also, when clinical trials are not using the identified keywords, of missing relevant clinical trials. The feedback of users is therefore very important to continue to improve the accuracy of the search filter.

This attitude is inhumane and incorrect. Even if hungry initially, people often do not consume adequate quantities of unvaried and unfamiliar foods for long enough. More importantly, the starving people are often ill and may not have a good appetite. They will therefore languish in an emaciated state or get even sicker.Even someone well-nourished would fail to thrive on the monotonous diets of three or so commodities (e.g. wheat, beans and oil) that is all that is available, month in, month out, to many refugees and displaced people. And this is aside from the micro-nutrient deficiencies that often develop. This misconception starts, in part, from a failure to agree on explict objectives for food assistance -- which should surely be to provide for health, welfare, and a reasonably decent existence and help in attaining and acceptable state of self-reliance and self-respect. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-myths-and-realities-in-disaster-situations

While less well documented, developing countries bear the brunt of the problem. People living in developing countries are more likely to be exposed to unhealthy environments through:Poor access to clean water to adequately wash food items Unsafe transportation and/or inadequate storage of foods Insufficient knowledge of safe food processing and handling practices Compromised immune responses to foodborne infections, particularly in populations where malnutrition and HIV/AIDS are prevalentThis is compounded by poor countries' limited capacity to enforce effective food safety measures, including:Efficient foodborne disease surveillance and monitoring systems Food safety regulations and functioning inspection systemsFood safety education programs and Effective emergency planning and relief. The high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in many developing countries, including those caused by parasites, points out the urgent need to prioritize foodborne disease prevention and control in national health and development plans. The full picture of the impact and costs of foodborne diseases - in industrial just as in developing countries - is to date unknown. Many foodborne disease outbreaks go unrecognized, unreported or uninvestigated and may only be visible if connected to situations that have a major public health or economic impact.

Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Especially in the Middle East, this group of people should avoid contact with dromedary camels, consuming raw camel milk or camel urine, as well as eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Camel farm and slaughterhouse workers should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing, facial protection, and protective clothing (which should be removed after work and washed daily). Workers should also avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with camels or camel excretions. Sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption. People should avoid direct contact with any animal that has been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)

It is not always possible to identify patients infected with MERS-CoV early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non-specific.
For this reason, it is important that health care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients.Droplet precautions should be added to standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for suspected or confirmed cases of MERS.

When disaster strikes, it can seriously disrupt the functioning of a community and people will depend on help from the outside. But a lot can be done to prevent and reduce the effects of disasters as well as to strengthen the response of communities at risk.Countries with well-developed health systems and a well-trained, well-equipped health workforce in communities are much better prepared for disasters. When a community is well-prepared, many lives can be saved in the first hours after an emergency before external help arrives. The people in the community know local risks and their own needs best.To reduce future risks and human and material losses, WHO helps countries build resilience in health systems by strengthening emergency risk management, an approach which includes measures ranging from prevention to preparedness to response and recovery. Emergency risk management actions include:creating supportive national policies, strategies and allocating resources to manage risks;improving access to quality primary health care before disaster strikes, as well as in response and recovery;training and equipping the health workforce and including them in the planning for all types of emergencies;identifying hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities to assess risks;promoting risk awareness of emergencies and providing health education (e.g. sanitation and hygiene);providing early warning of emergencies to health providers and communities; andprotecting health facilities from hazards and preparing for emergency health response.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-s-role-in-emergencies

In general terms, identifying a dead body is done by comparing information about the person while alive with information about the dead body. Thus, information about those who are missing or presumed to be dead is needed (a list of the missing, and specific individual information about each missing person). Also, information about the dead body is needed (photographs, preferably taken before decomposition has started, and information about identifying features, clothing and personal effects). To keep track of this information, the body needs to be given a unique code which must be in all the photographs, and on all the information collected; and attached to the body and the body bag, and any burial site, so that its location can be recorded, and the body retrieved at any time.

Yaws forms part of a group of chronic bacterial infections commonly known as the endemic treponematoses. These diseases are caused by spiral bacteria of the genus Treponema, which also includes endemic syphilis (bejel) and pinta. Yaws is the most common of these three infections.

It is caused by the bacterium - is a Treponema pallidumm subspecies pertenue and transmitted by skin contact. Yaws mainly affects the skin, but can also involve the bone and cartilage. The organism that causes yaws is closely related to the one that causes syphilis.

These tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis however, and the interpretation of results from these tests in adults who live in yaws endemic areas needs careful clinical assessment because of syphillis.
Rapid point-of-care tests that can be used in the field are widely available.
However, most of them are treponemal-based and cannot distinguish between past and current infection. Recently dual treponemal and nontreponemal rapid tests have become available, thus simplifying diagnosis in the field. These tests are able to detect both present and past infections to guide treatment of people with active infection.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the organisms in the skin lesions. It can also be used to monitor azithromycin resistance and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/yaws

45f14472-1453-4dff-a46c-940e20ca275f,How big is the problem of SF medical products?,"SF medical products are by their very nature difficult to detect. They are often designed to appear identical to the genuine product and may not cause an obvious adverse reaction, however they will fail to properly treat the disease or condition for which they were intended. There are many estimates of the scope and scale of the market in SF medical products but little validated evidence to underpin those estimates. WHO have withdrawn all of their previous estimations of the scale of the problem and in 2013 launched a global surveillance and monitoring system to encourage Member States to report SF incidents in a structured and systematic format, to assist in arriving at a more accurate and validated assessment of the scope, scale and harm caused by this issue. Medical products have so far been reported representing all main therapeutic categories and representing both innovator and generic medicines.In November 2017, WHO launched two important publications;WHO Global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions.Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue;Both publications provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm

What was once considered a problem suffered by developing and low income countries has now become an issue for all. With the exponential increase in internet connectivity those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have gained access to a global market place. This extends both to consumers and business to business forums. A culture of self-diagnosis and self-prescribing has led to the emergence of thousands of unregulated websites providing unsupervised access to SF medical products.

3a9df93f-bd7e-44cd-92dc-76f66909f1f7,What is the harm caused by SF medical products?,"Assessing the harm caused by SF medical products is complex and difficult. Most cases involve a medical product that fails to work properly. Often the product will not cause a toxic reaction, but will fail to treat the condition for which it was intended, with potentially devastating consequences. A patient failing to respond to their anti-malarial or who suffers an unwanted pregnancy will rarely consider the cause of the problem to be their medicine. Effective vigilance and awareness amongst healthcare professionals, efficient reporting mechanisms for patients as well as strong post market surveillance of medical products in circulation are needed in order to quickly identify problems.Some SF medical products do cause serious adverse reactions and sometimes fatalities. When these incidents occur in a close geographic area over a short time period they are more easily identified and reported.Cases are reported to WHO arising from an unexpected and disproportionate rise in mortality at healthcare facilities. The WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System and other WHO vigilance systems pick up these data.In November 2017, two important WHO publications were launched:WHO global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions.Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue;Both publications will provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm

Supply chains can be long and complex. The more extended the supply chain, the more vulnerable they are to weak links and the insertion of SF medical products.SF medical products are frequently found in unlicensed and illegal outlets, this includes street markets, hawkers and illegal internet pharmacies. However, they are also reported from legal and regulated venues such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and drug stores in all regions.

Traditionally sanctions have been weak and remain so in many countries. Strong legislation alone is not enough, criminal justice systems need to be willing to handle these types of cases in an effective and efficient manner. National medicines regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies need to collaborate and awareness raising is required amongst the prosecutors and the judiciary. Many investigations concerning SF medical products are international in nature. This makes gathering evidence more complex. Countries need to have in place mutual legal assistance treaties to permit gathering of evidence from other jurisdictions to support prosecutions. Member States with legal powers to restrain and confiscate assets and recover the proceeds of criminal activity have met with some success. Especially if laws allow for a proportion of the seized assets to be reinvested in purchasing detection devices and laboratory equipment or finance awareness campaigns and training events.In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high profit activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm

They operate a highly organised, professional, lucrative and criminal business. Others involved are relatively disorganised with small illegal manufacturing sites and local distribution.In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high return activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm

With the globalization of the pharmaceutical sector and wide access to internet and communications technologies, no single country or organization can hope to effectively tackle the problem in isolation.Some aspects of the issue require a regulatory response, others a criminal law response, but most require international collaboration. Many countries rely on existing mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties and co-operative arrangements, others do not have those facilities available.Having an effective regulatory and criminal legal framework in place at the national level, with dissuasive sanctions, is the first step towards preventing the proliferation of SF medical products. However, in addition to legislation an efficient investigative process and transparent criminal justice system is required to ensure the proportionate application of the law.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have carried out some work on developing a legislative framework in relation to this topic focusing on fraudulent medicine.The Council of Europe have drafted the Medicrime convention, which constitutes a binding International Instrument in the field of criminal law on the counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes involving threats to public health.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm

Vaccination is also safe. Side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once introduced. Scientists also constantly monitor information from several sources for any sign a vaccine may cause health risks, and if there is a concern, they take the appropriate investigative and corrective actions. These vaccine safety monitoring processes ensure that potential risks related to vaccination are kept to the minimum possible level. WHO works to make sure that vaccine safety systems exist everywhere so that anyone who receives a vaccine can have their concerns considered and investigated if needed.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-global-vaccine-safety
0f3147fc-654a-4376-9de3-dbc2de25aa1a,How does a vaccine work?,"To produce protection against a disease, vaccines activate biological reactions in the body. Those reactions vary depending on the type of vaccine and its mode of administration. In addition to developing its protective effect, vaccine reactions may include soreness or a mild fever that resolves in a few days. Severe reactions occur very rarely (less than one in 100 000 doses of vaccines administered) and these generally occur in people with pre-existing diseases. If this risk factor is known beforehand, it is possible to prevent any potential reaction.Proper vaccine storage, handling and administration is also important to ensure that vaccination is safe and effective. This is why WHO recommends that all health care personnel who administer vaccines receive comprehensive training before administering vaccines and are aware of their role in relation to monitoring for rare reactions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-global-vaccine-safety

For that reason, the safety of vaccines continues to be monitored even after they are in routine use. Any reports of possible side effects made by parents and health providers are carefully reviewed and may signal the need for further investigation. In addition, large populations of people who receive vaccines are often studied to identify any possible links between vaccination and rare or serious health conditions. If a problem is suspected, a thorough investigation will take place by health authorities and medical experts. Investigations usually involve more tests of vaccine quality, manufacturing processes, and studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated people who have and have not had reactions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-global-vaccine-safety

Babies and children need to get their vaccinations on time, so they get the best possible protection. It is important that health providers invite parents to share their questions and concerns during vaccination consultations and assure them that vaccines are the safest way to protect their children from infectious diseases.

Dogs, foxes and other carnivores harbour the adult worms in their intestine and evacuate the parasite eggs in their faeces. If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs.
Both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs.
Both diseases can cause serious morbidity and death.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/echinococcosis
d9a78875-8fb2-42ba-9a93-63e0bf2b3777,How is echinococcosis transmitted?,"A number of herbivorous and omnivorous animals act as intermediate hosts of Echinococcus by ingesting parasite eggs in contaminated soil and developing parasitic larval stages in their viscera. Carnivores are definitive hosts of the parasite; they are infected through the consumption of viscera of intermediate hosts that harbour the parasite and also through scavenging infected carcases. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts and are unable to transmit the disease.
Transmission of cystic echinococcosis is principally maintained in a dog–sheep–dog cycle, although several other domestic animals may be involved including goats, swine, horses, cattle, camels and yaks. Transmission of alveolar echinococcosis usually occurs in a wildlife cycle among foxes, other carnivores and small mammals (mostly rodents). Domesticated dogs and cats can also be infected.
For both diseases, humans become infected through the ingestion of soil, water or food (e.g. green vegetables, berries) contaminated with the parasites’ eggs shed in the faeces of the carnivores, and also by hand-to-mouth transfer of eggs after contact with the contaminated fur of a carnivore, most commonly a dog.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/echinococcosis

In cystic echinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts mainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys, spleen, muscles, central nervous system and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.
Alveolar echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the liver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs and brain following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system.

Four options exist for the treatment of abdominal cystic echinococcosis: (i) percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique; (ii) surgery; (iii) anti-parasitic drug treatment; and (iv) expectant management (“watch and wait”). The choice must primarily be based on the ultrasound images of the cyst, following a stage-specific approach, and also on the medical infrastructure and human resources available to treat patients.

Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements for alveolar echinococcosis. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery offers cure. Unfortunately, in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and palliative surgery, if carried out without or with incomplete anti-parasitic treatment, frequently results in relapses.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/echinococcosis

d9206cab-e58e-4f68-bae9-ca9b436647e4,"How many snakebites occur each year, and how many injuries/fatalities result from them?","It is very difficult to determine the number of snakebites that occur worldwide, but the best available evidence suggests that each year as many as 2.7 million people develop a clinical illness following a bite from a venomous snake. In the field of clinical toxinology, which studies snakebite and other illnesses caused by venomous and/or poisonous organisms, the term used for such an injury is “envenoming” (American “envenomation”), and patients suffering the effects of venomous snake bite are said to have been “envenomed”. Of the 2.7 million people envenomed each year, between 81,000 and 138,000 die as a result, and as many as 400 000 of the survivors are left permanently disabled.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
0a33a444-bd6e-4b5f-b69d-3043a1240f54,What makes snakebite a “neglected tropical disease”?,"There are four primary criteria that define an illness as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), and snakebite envenoming satisfies each of them:

First, there is a significant burden of mortality and morbidity (as detailed in the answer to question 1) – snakebite envenoming is a high-impact disease.
Secondly, a majority of incidents of snakebite occur in the world’s tropical and sub-tropical regions, and it particularly impacts the poor – snakebite is a tropical disease.
Thirdly, snakebite is amenable to treatment, as well as prevention – the impact of snakebite can be mitigated now if we make the effort to do so.
Finally, the overall level of investment in research addressing snakebite, from prevention to diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, is exceptionally low in comparison to its impact – snakebite is a neglected disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
1b614114-a3fc-45ff-ae20-361a8c821755,Where in the world do the most bites occur?,"The majority of snakebite envenoming cases occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the developing world. As many as 46 000 snakebite deaths happen in India alone; sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia, New Guinea, and Central and South America are also snakebite hot spots. Underscoring the fact that snakebite is a disease of the developing world are the incredible statistics from Australasia – although Australia itself is world famous for its diversity of highly venomous organisms, on average only 2 people die from snakebite there each year. In nearby New Guinea, on the other hand, an almost identical snake fauna (with, if anything, a lesser diversity of venomous species) claims more than 1000 lives each year. This is largely due to the differing socioeconomic and development levels of the two countries, and emphasizes the greater impact of snakebite envenoming in poor, less-developed communities.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming

5f65bf26-0581-4c23-8ef4-45761833c21e,What are the socioeconomic consequences of snakebite?,"The socioeconomic impacts of snakebite for survivors and their families can be dire.
In rural India, where 75% of people live on average monthly household incomes of just 5000 rupees (US$ 78), immediate treatment costs after snakebites of more than 350 000 rupees (US$ 5400) have been reported. The follow-on economic losses, due to loss of income or being forced to sell livestock, homes or land in order to meet additional costs, can be as high as 400 000 rupees (US$ 6215). Elsewhere in the developing world, the story is similar: those lucky enough to survive a venomous snakebite are often financially crippled by the cost of treatment, as well as physically crippled by the effects of the venom. Given that a majority of bite sufferers are among the most productive members of society (young, working age men and women), disablement following snakebite can prevent survivors from earning an income, making them a lifelong financial burden for their family members. In addition, snakebite survivors may suffer disfigurement and post-traumatic stress disorder, which can result in their becoming social pariahs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
abe05bd5-f483-4cbd-854e-21f5fe82dbea,Which species of snakes are responsible?,"The snake species implicated in serious snakebite injury vary from region to region, a fact that increases the challenge of mitigating the burden of snakebite worldwide. In India, the “big four” species are the Indian cobra (Naja naja), the Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii), the Indian saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) and the Indian krait (Bungarus caeruleus), although other species are also implicated in many life-threatening bites.
Throughout the rest of tropical Asia, a similar cohort of culprits occurs, and cobras (Naja ssp.), kraits (Bungarus ssp.) and Russell’s vipers (where they occur) are responsible for the lion’s share of serious bites.
In Africa, different types of cobras (Naja ssp.), multiple species of saw-scaled/carpet viper (Echis ssp.), and puff adders (Bitis arietans) are major culprits, although in some areas mambas (Dendroaspis ssp.) are also responsible for numerous bites, along with other species of viper (particularly other members of the genus Bitis).
In Central and South America, a range of pit-viper species, particularly lanceheads (genus Bothrops and related genera) and rattlesnakes (genus Crotalus) are responsible for the most bites, although coral snakes (genus Micrurus) are common in some areas and capable of inflicting life-threatening envenomations.
In New Guinea, the taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) is responsible for the most bites, followed by the death adders (Acanthophis spp.) – both groups of snakes occur also in parts of Australia, but bites in that country are very rare.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
9fc5b3b7-087f-43ef-9ad0-f2b34aaee5de,How can snakebite be prevented?,"It is often said that prevention is better than cure, and a majority of snakebite accidents are readily preventable. In many parts of the world where snakebite envenoming is very common, walking barefoot through snake-infested areas is a major cause of snakebite and as many as 80% of all snakebites occur on the legs or feet, below the knee. These could be prevented if people had access to cheap, practical and protective footwear, and were educated to understand the importance of wearing their shoes.
Snakes are typically shy creatures that spend most of their time hiding, and piles of human rubbish and old construction materials make perfect shelter sites. Cleaning up and keeping the grass short in areas in close proximity to dwellings, along pathways, and in places where children play, are measures that can reduce the likelihood of snakebites. Similarly using a light when walking outside at night is essential in areas where some snakes forage after dark. Even the short walk from the house to an outdoor latrine can be fatal if you step on a snake in the dark.
Many homes in areas where snakebite is endemic are constructed in such a way that snakes can gain access. Sealing houses so that snakes cannot enter the dwelling can help to prevent snakebites, but if this is not possible, the simple act of sleeping on a raised platform with a well-tucked in mosquito net can prevent not only mosquito-borne diseases but also snakebites.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
82d4f081-13e6-4c71-bcbd-b8f1845fc1de,What is the appropriate first aid for snakebite?,"Most of the methods currently proposed as first aid for snakebites are either ineffective, dangerous, or delay proper medical treatment. Even methods that have been recommended by medical authorities in one part of the world may not be appropriate for use in other places because of the differences in the types of effects that different snake venoms can have.
Methods such as the use of narrow tourniquets, excision or incision of the wounds or the affected limb, the use of chemicals such as potassium permanganate or the application of heated glass containers to produce suction, can all be dangerous as well as ineffective and should not be used. Other types of first aid, such as the use of the Belgian black stone, are simply ineffective and waste valuable time.
The best approach is to immobilize the bitten person and keep them from moving around at all. The application of pressure at the bite-site via a pressure pad, a compression bandage applied to the bitten limb, or both, may be effective in delaying the onset of systemic effects, but is only recommended for bites from snakes with predominantly neurotoxic venom, and not for those that cause significant local tissue damage.
Place envenomed patients on a makeshift stretcher and transport them to medical care without delay. If possible place them on their side to help protect their airway and breathing.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
3c1fe49a-4186-49ff-b0d5-a1ca50691716,What effective treatments exist for snakebite?,"Administration of the appropriate antivenom is the most effective treatment for life-threatening snakebite. The best response to antivenom is likely when it is administered as soon as possible following a bite, as many of the effects of snake venom are irreversible, including some neurotoxic, cytotoxic, haemorrhagic and haemotoxic effects.
Snake venoms are also highly variable in their toxic components and effects. This variation exists not only among species but often also within a single species among geographical regions, age and size classes, or between the sexes. As a result, antivenom raised against the venom of one species or population may not be effective in the treatment of envenoming by snakes from other species or even other populations of the same species. There are often barriers that complicate the task of ensuring early access to appropriate antivenom to snakebite victims, including lack of appropriate transport networks in developing countries, lack of unbroken cold chain-based distribution systems that can maintain the integrity of antivenom (which may require refrigeration) in rural and remote areas, and general lack of infrastructure associated with healthcare facilities. Surmounting these challenges is essential to effective control of snakebite envenoming.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/snakebite-envenoming
25fd92b9-55ce-49c6-b4f5-61c04ac30c71,What can we do to mitigate the impacts of snakebite?,"Reducing the burden of snakebite in the tropical developing world is a massive task, with many complicating factors, some of which have been detailed above.
The first step is securing the requisite resources via commitments from WHO Member States, donors and other funding bodies. Supporting the development of functional health systems and other infrastructure in the worst affected regions will not only help reduce the number of snakebite casualties, but contribute to the capacity to fight the myriad other diseases that afflict these areas.
Education, both about the prevention of snakebite, and about appropriate treatment in the event of an accident, is a crucial piece of the puzzle.
Increased investment in research that can deliver tangible and sustainable solutions is essential, particularly with respect to developing and rolling out better diagnostic tools and therapeutic treatments, and improved control tools and strategies.

8143c2ed-baeb-46ef-9252-73e82567d417,Does polio still exist? Is it curable?,"Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases to 22 reported cases in 2017. This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease. Today, only 3 countries in the world have never stopped transmission of polio (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria).Despite the progress achieved since 1988, as long as a single child remains infected with poliovirus, children in all countries are at risk of contracting the disease. The poliovirus can easily be imported into a polio-free country and can spread rapidly amongst unimmunized populations. Failure to eradicate polio could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world.There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/poliomyelitis
8df83b77-8e75-4a8a-8395-f3465a06a549,What is vaccine-derived polio?,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out.On rare occasions, if a population is seriously under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for an extended period of time. The longer it is allowed to survive, the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse – this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV).It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the risk of cases of cVDPV2.The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. Well over 10 million cases have been averted since large-scale administration of OPV began 20 years ago.Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of the virus.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/poliomyelitis

This also induces a contraction of the female worm at the base of the ulcer causing the sudden expulsion of hundreds of thousands of first stage larvae into the water. They move actively in the water, where they can live for a few days.For further development, these larvae need to be ingested by suitable species of voracious predatory crustacean, Cyclops or water fleas which measure 1–2 mm and are abundant worldwide. In the cyclops, larvae develop to the infective third-stage in 14 days at 26°C.When a person drinks contaminated water from ponds or shallow open wells, the cyclops is dissolved by the gastric acid of the stomach and the larvae are released and migrate through the intestinal wall. After 100 days, the male and female meet and mate. The male becomes encapsulated and dies in the tissues while the female moves down the muscle planes.

Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and lasts for 2-7 days. Dengue fever usually occurs after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite of the infected mosquito.
High Fever (40°C/ 104°F) is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms:

Headaches
Pain behind eyes
Nausea, vomiting
Swollen glands
Joint, bone or muscle pains
Rash

Severe dengue
When developing into severe dengue, the critical phase takes place around 3-7 days after the first sign of illness. Temperature will decrease; this does NOT mean the person is necessarily recovering. On the other hand, special attention needs to be given to these warning signs as it could lead to severe dengue:

Severe abdominal pain
Persistent vomiting
Bleeding gums
Vomiting blood
Rapid breathing
Fatigue/ restlessness

When severe dengue is suspected, the person should be rushed to the emergency room or to the closest health care provider as it causes:

ac749d1e-9e56-4f96-86e0-0a8935f60343,What is the treatment for dengue?,"There is no vaccine or specific medication for dengue fever.
Patients should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids. Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and reduce joint pains. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding.
Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection via Aedes mosquitoes after the first symptoms appear (during 4-5 days; maximum 12). As a precautionary approach, patients can adopt measures to reduce transmission by sleeping under a treated net especially during the period of illness with fever.
Infection with one strain will provide life-time protection only against that particular strain. However, it is still possible to become infected by other strains and develop into severe dengue.
When warning signs of severe dengue are present (listed above), it is imperative to consult a doctor and seek hospitalization to manage the disease.

5f8c994d-baa2-4b22-a8ba-820cb48f8f10,Who spreads dengue and severe dengue?,"Dengue is spread through the bite of the female mosquito (Aedes aegypti). The mosquito becomes infected when it takes the blood of a person infected with the virus. After about one week, the mosquito can then transmit the virus while biting a healthy person. The mosquito can fly up to 400 meters looking for water-filled containers to lay their eggs but usually remains close to the human habitation.
Aedes aegypti is a daytime feeder: The peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk.
Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. However, a person infected and suffering from dengue fever can infect other mosquitoes. Humans are known to carry the infection from one country to another or from one area to another during the stage when the virus circulates and reproduces in the blood system.
Aedes aegypti has evolved into an intermittent biter and prefers to bite more than one person during the feeding period. This mechanism has made Aedes aegypti a very highly efficient epidemic vector mosquito.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/dengue-and-severe-dengue
ce42f6b2-acc5-4c7f-82ed-27dd2cbef6bd,Where do the mosquitoes breed?,"The mosquitoes thrive in areas close to human population (urban areas).
The dengue mosquito lays its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house and surrounding areas of dwellings (this includes non-used bottles, containers, discarded waste, tyres etc… which hold water).
The eggs hatch when in contact with water. Eggs can withstand very dry conditions and survive for months. Female mosquitoes lay dozens of eggs up to 5 times during their lifetime.
Adult mosquitoes “usually” rest indoors in dark areas (closets, under beds, behind curtains). Here it is protected from wind, rain and most predators, which increases its life expectancy and the probability that it will live long enough to pick up a virus from one person and pass it on to the next.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/dengue-and-severe-dengue

Lowering the number of eggs, larvae and pupae will reduce the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and the transmission of the disease. Examples of the following habitats are listed:

Indoor

Ant traps
Flower vases and saucers
Water storage tank (domestic drinking water, bathroom, etc…)
Plastic containers
Bottles


Outdoor

Discarded bottles and tins
Discarded tyres
Artificial containers
Tree holes, potholes, construction sites
Drums for collecting rainwater
Shells, husks, pods from trees
Leaf axils of various plants
Boats, equipment



Items that collect rainwater or are used to store water should be covered or properly discarded. The remaining essential containers should be emptied and cleaned and scrubbed (to remove eggs) at least once a week. This will avoid the adult mosquitoes to emerge from the egg/ larva/ pupa stage.

example as a separate policy document, a national quality statement, or as part of a broader
national health policy document. Policy can be a useful tool for engaging stakeholders, building
support for the national quality effort and establishing the structures and environment needed for
success. The strategy then goes on to provide a clear explanation of how the policy will be put into
practice, including detail on how each of the priorities will be met, and provides a clear framework
for organizing the initiative. Strategy provides the level of detail needed to drive implementation.

4c6af1ec-dc5b-44b4-a27c-84cd29286e52,What is the difference between oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine?,"Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) consists of inactivated (killed) strains of all three poliovirus types (1, 2 and 3). IPV is given as an injection and must be administered by a trained health worker. IPV causes the body to produce antibodies in the blood to all three types of poliovirus. In the event of infection, these antibodies prevent the spread of the virus to the central nervous system and protect against paralysis. In this way, IPV prevents that person from being paralyzed if exposed to polio, but it does not stop transmission of the virus.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) consists of live, attenuated (weakened) poliovirus strains of one or two poliovirus types. OPV is given as a drop in the mouth. It can be administered by trained volunteers and does not require a nurse, doctor or midwife for administration. When fully immunized, a person develops “gut immunity” and will no longer transmit the virus type included in the vaccine even if they are exposed (e.g. if they are vaccinated with type 2-containg OPV, they will no longer transmit type 2 virus). Thanks to this gut immunity, OPV is the only effective weapon to stop transmission of the poliovirus when an outbreak is detected. Bivalent OPV protects against poliovirus type 1 and 3, while monovalent OPV 2 protects against type 2.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-polio-outbreak-in-the-philippines

Normally, tiny glands in the lining of the airways make a small amount of mucus. Mucus keeps the airways moist and traps any dust and dirt in the inhaled air. Because bronchiectasis creates an abnormal widening of the airways, extra mucus tends to form and pool in parts of the widened airways.

For example, a condition called primary ciliary dyskinesia affects the cilia so they do not move correctly to clear the mucus. Cystic fibrosis is another condition that affects the lungs and causes bronchiectasis. Inhaled objects can become stuck and block an airway. This may lead to local damage to that airway. Acid from the stomach that is regurgitated and inhaled can damage airways as well as inhaling poisonous gases.Severe lung infections such as tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, pneumonia or measles can damage the airways at the time of infection.

These pauses cut off the oxygen supply to your body for a few seconds and halt the removal of carbon dioxide. As a result of this, your brain briefly wakes you up, re-opens the airways and re-starts breathing. This can occur many times during the night and makes proper sleep impossible.

The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.
There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family member to child, and also by sexual contact. Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms, or may include symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis
c0bb3dbb-a4c2-4d44-8833-949c28bb1e35,What are the different hepatitis viruses?,"Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis

No one can formulate a precise and reliable plan for the eradication of human malaria nor calculate what it will cost. SAGme concluded that, especially with the stalling of process over the past 2 years, we must get the world back on track to meet the GTS targets. To do this, we need a renewed drive towards research and development, including on malaria vaccines and other approaches and tools.We also need political leaders to ensure everyone has access to affordable health care.

Why can’t we work towards a target date to eradicate malaria?,"If we consider smallpox, the burden of the disease was relatively low when WHO launched an eradication campaign in 1967. At the time, we had a highly efficacious vaccine and could actually foresee an end date.  When the polio eradication campaign was launched in 1988, there were an estimated 330 000 cases of the disease and we had a highly effective vaccine. The campaign originally had a 12 or 15-year timeline. However, 30 years later, despite massive progress,
the job has still not been completed.  In the case of malaria, we have more than 200 million cases annually, and we don’t have optimal tools. The SAGme believes that setting a date now, when there are so many uncertainties, may actually be counterproductive. Instead, the group is calling
for an accelerated effort to achieve the already-approved targets of the GTS, a framework that includes 5-year targets for reductions in malaria cases and deaths through 2030.  Following this alternative approach will actually take us along the path towards eradication. We can assess our progress at five-year intervals and eventually determine the tipping point -- when a time-limited, credible, achievable campaign to fully eradicate
malaria could be launched. We are clearly not there yet.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/malaria-eradication

Less probable, but theoretically possible, is female to male transmission. More surveillance data and research are needed on the risks of sexual transmission, and particularly on the prevalence of viable and transmissible virus in semen over time. In the interim, and based on present evidence, WHO recommends that:All Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should receive counselling to ensure safe sexual practices until their semen has twice tested negative. Survivors should be provided with condoms.Male Ebola survivors should be offered semen testing at 3 months after onset of disease, and then, for those who test positive, every month thereafter until their semen tests negative for virus twice by RT-PCR, with an interval of one week between tests.Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should either:abstain from all types of sex, orobserve safe sex through correct and consistent condom use until their semen has twice tested negative.Having tested negative, survivors can safely resume normal sexual practices without fear of Ebola virus transmission.Based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus.Until such time as their semen has twice tested negative for Ebola, survivors should practise good hand and personal hygiene by immediately and thoroughly washing with soap and water after any physical contact with semen, including after masturbation.

events to
promote the Decade and its aims. On 20 September 2016 the co-convenors
launched a major consultation process to develop the work programme of
the Decade.A series of consultations through coordination mechanisms such
as UNSCN and multistakeholder platforms such as CFS, on-line forums and
face-to-face meetings are being prepared to engage as many stakeholders
as possible in the strategic process of developing the work programme.
Participants will be invited to share views and ideas as well as receive
feedback from countries and stakeholders on their expectations for the
upcoming ten years.Many countries and other actors are already strongly committed
to existing food and nutrition initiatives, mechanisms, alliances,
movements or partnerships. These efforts will provide the structure for
action. The umbrella of the Decade creates a framework for sharing

185b30da-2715-4183-9ca8-587beadcb364,How is the work programme for the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition being prepared and implemented?,"The work programme of the Decade will be a global programme but with action at the country level.
Setting out the work programme of the Decade will be an
inclusive, continuous, and collaborative process, building upon and
connecting the independent initiatives of governments and their many
partners.Advocating for commitments by all stakeholders to implement
specific interventions, policies, programmes and investments for action
on nutrition in all relevant sectors will be crucial in order to bring
about a real and meaningful system change to end all forms of
malnutrition. The Decade will provide a standardized global framework
for making, reporting and monitoring progress and for tracking results.All stakeholders are invited to submit inputs to the work
programme of the Decade, taking as reference the six pillars identified
in the ICN2 Framework for Action. These six pillars are:sustainable food systems for healthy diets;
aligned health systems providing universal coverage of essential nutrition actions;social protection and nutrition education;trade and investment for improved nutrition;
enabling food and breastfeeding environments; and
review, strengthen and promote nutrition governance and accountability.Stakeholders are encouraged to set, track and achieve
specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART)
commitments. This will help all stakeholders understand what action is
intended and
improve tracking.Three groups of catalytic mechanisms will support the progress
on nutrition commitments across the Decade: evidence informed advocacy,
convening platforms and accountability mechanisms.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/nutrition-the-decade-of-action

Development Goals (SDGs) at the UN General Assembly in September 2015,
world leaders committed to rid the world of the twin scourges of poverty
and hunger and set out a vision for a fairer, more inclusive,
prosperous, peaceful and sustainable world in which no one is left
behind. SDG 2 in particular, aims to end hunger, achieve food security
and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.The achievement of the 2030 SDGs will only be met when much
greater political focus is given towards improving nutrition, as
nutrition is both an input and outcome of sustainable development.The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition provides an opportunity
for all partners to work together, mobilize action and accelerate efforts
towards the elimination of hunger, food insecurity and all forms of
malnutrition and meeting the SDGs by 2030.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/nutrition-the-decade-of-action

In addition, WHO Member States have formally requested that WHO’s Director General, through World Health Assembly Resolution WHA67.22 (Access to essential medicines, 2014), support countries to “ensure access to safe, effective and quality-assured essential medicines, including high price essential medicines.”The current status of medicines prices is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges to health systems everywhere and is the subject of countless debates in parliaments and in both medical and mainstream media. The time is ripe for greater involvement of the global health community to discuss this issue and seek realistic solutions for greater affordability. The main barrier to accessing many new and effective medicines, especially for cancer and orphan drugs, and more recently for hepatitis C, is their lack of affordability, even when there is evidence to show that manufacturing them is relatively inexpensive. This problem is now touching not only low-income countries, it is affecting middle- and high-income countries as well.At the other end of the spectrum is the problem of drug shortages or poor quality for some old and off-patent medicines. There are a number of examples, ranging from benzathine penicillin to methotrexate, where there are significant problems with lack of manufacturers.

The RR provides the ratio of the probabilities to get a certain disease or to die due to a disease when two differently exposed groups are compared.A common form of the formula for estimating the PAF is the following. It can accommodate several exposure levels which a population can be exposed to (2):where pi is the proportion of the population exposed at exposure level i, p'i is the counterfactual exposure distribution and RRi is the relative risk at exposure level i. The counterfactual exposure distribution is the exposure level with no or very low disease risk (i.e., RR of 1).A simplified formula applicable to only two levels of exposure (exposed and unexposed) is the following (3):These formulas assume no confounding or effect modification. Only RRs from studies of high quality epidemiological should be used in such assessments.Further readingWHO, 2004: Comparative Quantification of Health RisksWHO, 2003: Quantifying environmental health impacts: Introduction and methodsGBD 2017 Risk Factor Collaborator (2018) Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks for 195 countries and territories. 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.Lancet. 2018 Nov 10;392(10159):1923-1994. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32225-6.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor

They however correspond to the state of the science, provided that certain conditions apply. The following issues need to be carefully verified/considered and to be made transparent: (a) The causality of the respective exposure-disease pairs has been assessed and validated; (b) the combined relative risks from epidemiological studies need to be free from confounding and effect modification and should be applicable to the relevant population groups; (c) the exposure definition used in the relative risk and the exposure estimates need to correspond; and (d) the relative risk estimates used for estimating population attributable fractions (PAFs) generally need to stem from pooled analyses of the available evidence, such as from rigorously performed meta-analyses.Further readingEzzati et al. 2002: Selected major risk factors and global and regional burden of disease",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor

Exposure estimates may vary according to the assessment method used. Countries may have additional exposure data and a finer resolution as compared to global assessments.

This means that it is not possible to determine who died earlier or contracted disease because of exposure to the risk factor at the individual level.The PAF may not fully capture morbidity and mortality that occurred earlier in time due to exposure (i.e., that occurred both in the exposed and the unexposed group, but earlier in the exposed group due to exposure).Further readingGreenland and Robins, 1988: Conceptual problems in the definition and interpretation of attributable fractionsCOMEAP, 2010: The Mortality Effects of Long-Term Exposure to Particulate Air Pollution in the United Kingdom",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor

It is always there, so there is always something to practice with and keep skills sharp. Because flu is a continual threat there is a lot of learning that goes on which also supports work on other emerging diseases. It’s like the basic architecture for capacity building in all areas. For example, you can practice your communications for responding to outbreaks and better understand the behavioral aspects of vaccine hesitancy. You can build your laboratory capacity and surveillance and response capacity and use it for other things infectious threats such as MERS or SARS or other respiratory threats. Influenza can also help you learn how to implement a vaccine programme and introduce new drugs.

6c398d11-23b3-49d0-b7ae-64109fdc46cb,What is the best practice for fully eliminating trans fat?,"Mandatory national limits on industrially-produced trans fat are the most effective way to reduce trans fat in the food supply.19 There are two primary models for mandatory limits. The first, pioneered in Denmark, limits industrially-produced trans fat to no more than 2 grams/100 grams of total fat/oils in all foods, and applies to domestic and imported products. The second model, recently adopted by the United States and Canada and going into effect in mid-2018, reclassifies PHO (the source of industrially-produced trans fat) as an unsafe food additive (US) or a contaminant or other adulterating substance in food (Canada26), essentially banning industrially-produced trans fat.Most countries that have passed regulations or legislation followed the Denmark model, including Austria, Chile, Ecuador, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Singapore, and South Africa. Latvia, Slovenia, and Sweden have passed similar limits that have not yet gone into effect. Argentina, Colombia, Iran and Switzerland have similar restrictions in effect, with 2% trans fat limits in fats and oils plus, in the case of Argentina and Colombia, 5% trans fat limits in fats and oils for other foods.

In many cases, tropical vegetable oils high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) are the least expensive and most accessible alternative oils, so government technical support is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises. Government support can include: subsidies, e.g. removing subsidies on PHOs and tropical oils high in SFA; introducing agricultural policies to reduce cost and increase availability of healthy oil alternatives; and funding for innovation research on healthy replacement oils. Argentina is a good example of government working with industry to increase the supply of healthy alternatives.22",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/nutrition-trans-fat
6fe00a65-bd7b-48bf-9125-9e6912cb87c0,How does nutrition labelling support reducing trans fat intake?,"Including saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat content on packaged food nutrition labels allows monitoring of compliance with mandatory trans fat limits and concomitant changes in SFA. Labelling provides a foundation for either voluntary programs to limit trans fat or local/national laws or regulation. Coupled with consumer education, media attention and advocacy, labelling can lead to reformulation, as in the United States. However, it is unlikely to lead to the full elimination of trans fat in the food supply.27 Almost 10 years after labelling was mandated in the United States and Canada, regulations are being put in place to ban partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply. While including trans fat levels on labels is important, health claims such as “trans fat free” should not be allowed unless other specific food criteria are met; single nutrient claims can be used to increase the market appeal of unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt or saturated fat. The effectiveness of labelling regulations may be limited in low- and middle- income countries, where the main source of trans fats is often food purchased from street vendors rather than packaged food.19",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/nutrition-trans-fat

support effective strategies, and lessons from experiences in
more challenging contexts can be applied to ensure successful
policy implementation and monitoring. Countries with large
informal food sectors may be challenging, as they are difficult to
regulate. However, by mandating that the oil and fats industry
limit (or ban) trans fat content, the oils and fats available on
the market can help drive change in product formulation in the
informal food sector. Additionally, a trans fat monitoring system
including random tests in the formal and informal sectors can be
established, with specific penalties. There are models for sampling

to spur both governments and industry to take action. Knowledge
of trans fat exposure, either based on surveys or measuring trans
fat in foods, has been catalytic and very useful to advocates.
For example, in Argentina, the media disseminated scientific
and practical information to the public on the harmful effects
of trans fat, catalysing change and creating demand, resulting
in replacement of approximately 40% of the trans fats that
were produced annually with other fats.22 In Denmark, a 1993
landmark study published in The Lancet along with subsequent
government reports on the impact of trans fat in Denmark initiated
years of media attention, which led to public awareness and
industry support. In Canada, scientific findings found that Canada
had one of the highest average levels of trans fat intake in the
world (8.4 grams per day in 1995), leading to public concern
and government response. In addition, as trans fat regulations
generally do not specify the types of oils for trans fat replacement,
the role of advocating for healthy replacement oils (i.e. oils low in
saturated fatty acids and high monounsaturated fatty acids and
polyunsaturated fatty acids) is particularly important.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/nutrition-trans-fat

Together, these trials included over 35,000 participants aged 2 to 16 years: ages at first vaccination were 2 to 14 years in CYD14, 9 to 16 years in CYD15. In each of these trials, participants were randomized to vaccine and placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The study protocols included an active phase of follow-up for one year after the last dose of vaccine in the series (25 months from dose 1) and include a hospital-based follow-up period of four additional years, which is ongoing.

Vaccine efficacy against confirmed dengue pooled across both trials was 59.2% in the year following the primary series (per protocol analysis). During this initial time period, pooled vaccine efficacy against severe dengue was 79.1%. Efficacy varied by serotype: vaccine efficacy was higher against serotypes 3 and 4 (71.6% and 76.9%, respectively) than for serotypes 1 and 2 (54.7% and 43.0%). Vaccine efficacy also varied by age at vaccination and serostatus at baseline (i.e., previous exposure to dengue prior to vaccination).
When limited to older age groups (ages included in the current licensure), pooled vaccine efficacy amongst all participants aged 9 years or over was 65.6%, and in participants aged <9 years="""" it="""" was="""">
Within the randomized subset of participants for whom pre-vaccination blood samples were collected, pooled vaccine efficacy against VCD in those seropositive for a prior exposure to dengue virus was 78.2%, while in those seronegative at baseline it was 38.1% (not statistically significant). In a post-hoc analysis in those ≥9 years of age, vaccine efficacy in those seronegative at baseline was 52.5% (95% CI 5.9%, 76.1%).
While efficacy was reported against hospitalized and severe dengue in Years 1 and 2 post-dose 1, an excess of cases of hospitalized and severe dengue cases in those receiving CYD-TDV was seen in Year 3 in some subgroups, although it is based on relatively small numbers of cases. The excess was mostly observed in those vaccinated aged 2-5 years in CYD14 in Asia, for which the relative risk of hospitalized dengue in vaccinees was 7.45 (95% CI 1.15, 313.80) in Year 3, based on 15 cases in the CYD-TDV group and 1 case in the control group. This younger age group has not been included in the age indication of the vaccine. No safety signals were reported in the older age groups at the time of the April 2016 SAGE recommendations. SAGE noted that the evidence of the absence of a safety issue in seronegative individuals aged 9 and above was based on the limited data set of 10%-20% of the trial population, and highlighted the urgent need to better describe the long-term benefit-risk ratio of CYD-TDV in seronegative individuals.
On 29 November 2017, Sanofi Pasteur announced the results of additional studies to better describe the benefit-risk in seronegative individuals. This was made possible through the use of a newly developed NS1-based antibody assay applied to blood samples taken 13 months after vaccination to retrospectively infer dengue serostatus at time of first vaccination.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/dengue-vaccines
7d5d2a8f-881b-4d76-ba71-2f115df3842a,What are the findings from the additional analyses on long-term safety follow up stratified by serostatus at time of first vaccination?,"The new analyses from the long-term safety follow-up indicated that:

Overall population level benefit of vaccination remains favorable, but the vaccine performs differently in seropositive versus seronegative individuals.
Vaccine efficacy (VE) against virologically confirmed symptomatic dengue was high among inferred baseline seropositive participants ≥9 years of age: 76% (95%CI: 63.9, to 84.0), but much lower among baseline seronegative participants: 38.8% (95%CI: –0.9 to 62.9%) in the first 25 months after the first dose of vaccine.
There is an increased risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in seronegative individuals starting about 30 months after the first dose.
In areas of 70% dengue seroprevalence, over a 5-year follow-up, for every 4 severe cases prevented in seropositive, there would be one excess severe case in seronegative per 1,000 vaccinees; for every 13 hospitalizations prevented in seropositive vaccinees, there would be 1 excess hospitalization in seronegative vaccinees per 1,000 vaccinees.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/dengue-vaccines
ae746e7e-cc45-4b93-90a6-bd1efdb061b2,What are WHO’s recommendations related to CYD-TDV?,"Following the release of the long-term safety data stratified by serostatus on 29 November 2017, a SAGE working group on dengue vaccines was reconvened and a thorough review of the new data with the guidance of external experts such ethicists and modellers was conducted.
In light of the new evidence on the long-term safety issue in seronegative individuals, balanced against the documented efficacy and safety in seropositive individuals, SAGE carefully considered two strategies: population seroprevalence criteria versus pre-vaccination screening. SAGE weighed up the feasibility of population seroprevalence studies and individual pre-vaccination screening, heterogeneity of seroprevalence between and within countries, potential vaccine coverage rates, public confidence in national vaccination programmes, perceptions of ethical considerations with regard to population level benefit versus individual level risk, and communication issues.
SAGE concluded that for countries considering vaccination as part of their dengue control program, a “pre-vaccination screening strategy” would be the preferred option, in which only dengue-seropositive persons are vaccinated.
Serological testing for past dengue infection (e.g. dengue IgG ELISA) could be used to identify persons who have had previous dengue infections. Currently available rapid diagnostic tests, despite their lower sensitivity and specificity to detect past dengue infection compared with conventional dengue IgG ELISA, could be considered in high transmission settings until better tests are available. In settings with high seroprevalence, a test with lower specificity might be acceptable. In settings with low to moderate seroprevalence, a test with high specificity is needed.
Given that no test will be 100% specific, some truly seronegative individuals may be vaccinated due to a false positive test result. Furthermore, although the efficacy against dengue infections in seropositive individuals is high, it is still not complete. Hence, the limitations of CYD-TDV will need to be clearly communicated to those offered vaccination.
Decisions about implementing a pre-vaccination screening strategy will require careful assessment at the country level, including sensitivity and specificity of a screening, dengue hospitalization rates, and affordability of both CYD-TDV and tests. Vaccination should be considered as part of an integrated dengue prevention and control strategy together with well-executed and sustained vector control and the best evidence-based clinical care.
The vaccine should be used within the indicated age range, typically 9 to 45 years of age. The optimal age group to be targeted is the age at which the incidence of severe dengue is highest, and this can be ascertained from national and subnational routine hospital data.
In the absence of data on vaccine efficacy and safety with fewer than three doses, CYD-TDV is recommended as a three-dose series given 6 months apart.
SAGE highlighted that important research and implementation questions remain for CYD-TDV, in particular the development of a highly sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic test to determine serostatus, simplified immunization schedules, and assessment of the need for boosters.

It may develop in a patient who is receiving treatment for active TB, when anti-TB drugs are misused or mismanaged, and is usually a sign of inadequate clinical care or drug management. It can happen when patients are not properly supported to complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, or the wrong dose, or for too short a period of time; when the supply of drugs to the clinics dispensing drugs is erratic; or when the drugs are of poor quality.The second way that people can develop XDR-TB is by becoming infected from a patient who is already ill with the condition. Patients with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking. A person needs only to breathe in a small number of these germs to become infected. However only a small proportion of people infected with TB germs develop the disease.

In order to protect other patients and health workers in the hospital, isolation of such patients is part of good quality care. Once the diagnosis is made and treatment begun, for patients who are willing to undergo treatment, isolation is usually neither necessary nor appropriate.Isolation has a very limited role to play in patients in whom treatment has failed. Studies have shown that treating TB patients at home with appropriate infection measures in place generally poses no substantial risk to other members of the household. By the time a diagnosis is made, the household contacts have already been exposed to the patient’s infection.However, in the absence of options for curative treatment, all infection control measures at household should be strengthened. Whenever this is not feasible then options for voluntary isolation and delivery of palliative and end of life care should be offered to the patient.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)

b02aa6e6-b315-4937-8bb6-3eb2dd172cde,What is TB? How does it spread? How is it treated?,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable.
TB is spread from person to person through the air. When
people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into
the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become
infected.About one-third of the world's population has latent TB, which
means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill
with disease and cannot transmit the disease.People infected with TB bacteria have a lifetime risk of
falling ill with TB of 10%. However persons with compromised immune
systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or
people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill.When a person develops active TB (disease), the symptoms
(cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss etc.) may be mild for many
months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in
transmission of the bacteria to others. People ill with TB can infect up
to 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year.
Without proper treatment up to two thirds of people ill with TB will
die.Since 2000, 53 million lives have been saved through effective
diagnosis and treatment. Active, drug-sensitive TB disease is treated
with a standard 6-month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs that are
provided with information, supervision and support to the patient by a
health worker or trained volunteer. The vast majority of TB cases can be
cured when medicines are provided and taken properly.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis
d8958d3c-27d6-49dc-b704-8b892df38626,What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and how do we control it?,"The bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) can develop resistance to the antimicrobial drugs used to cure the disease. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is TB that does not respond to at least
isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful anti-TB drugs.
The 2 reasons why multidrug resistance continues to emerge and
spread are mismanagement of TB treatment and person-to-person
transmission. Most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed,
6-month drug regimen that is provided to patients with support and
supervision. Inappropriate or incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs, or
use of ineffective formulations of drugs (such as use of single drugs,
poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions), and premature
treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be
transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and
hospitals. 
In some countries, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
treat MDR-TB. Treatment options are limited and expensive, recommended
medicines are not always available, and patients experience many adverse
effects from the drugs. In some cases even more severe drug-resistant
TB may develop. Extensively drug-resistant TB, XDR-TB, is a form of
multidrug-resistant TB with additional resistance to more anti-TB drugs
that therefore responds to even fewer available medicines. It has been
reported in 117 countries worldwide.
Drug resistance can be detected using special laboratory tests
which test the bacteria for sensitivity to the drugs or detect
resistance patterns. These tests can be molecular in type (such as Xpert
MTB/RIF) or else culture-based. Molecular techniques can provide
results within hours and have been successfully implemented even in low
resource settings.
New WHO recommendations aim to speed up detection and improve
treatment outcomes for MDR-TB through use of a novel rapid diagnostic
test and a shorter, cheaper treatment regimen. At less than US$ 1000 per
patient, the new treatment regimen can be completed in 9–12 months. Not
only is it less expensive than current regimens, but it is also
expected to improve outcomes and potentially decrease deaths due to
better adherence to treatment and reduced loss to follow-up.
Solutions to control drug-resistant TB are to:

cure the TB patient the first time around
provide access to diagnosis
ensure adequate infection control in facilities where patients are treated
ensure the appropriate use of recommended second-line drugs.

In 2016, an estimated 490 000 people worldwide developed
MDR-TB, and an additional 110 000 people with rifampicin-resistant TB
were also newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment. The countries with the
largest numbers
of MDR/RR-TB cases (47% of the global total) were China, India and the
Russian Federation. It is estimated that about 6.2% of these cases were
XDR-TB.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-(mdr-tb)

The GRADE approach is designed to assess the effectiveness of specific interventions, such as a new treatment for a disease. It rates evidence derived from randomized controlled trials as “high quality”, while evidence from epidemiological studies, surveillance programmes and other sources of observational data, in which unknown confounders cannot be adequately controlled for, is rated initially as “low quality”, which can be upgraded according to specific criteria.In common with many important public health issues, due to ethical and technical complexity, there are very few randomized controlled studies that have assessed associations between use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and risks of human exposure to and infection by drug-resistant zoonotic pathogens. Most of the supporting scientific evidence – the best available - was collected from epidemiological studies, surveillance programmes and observational studies.In addition to the quality of the evidence and the balance of benefits and harms of an intervention, a number of other factors are considered when Guideline Development Groups formulate recommendations. These factors include the relative value placed on the potential beneficial and harmful outcomes of an intervention, the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, resource considerations, and effects on equity across subpopulations. A “strong recommendation” means that after taking all relevant considerations into account, the Guideline Development Group is reasonably certain that the desirable consequences (benefits) of an intervention outweigh the undesirable consequences (risks or harms), such that the intervention should be implemented in most contexts.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain

route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. All forms are treatable and
curable if detected early enough. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally

pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to
the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then
becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ""bubo"". At advanced
stages of infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores
filled with puss. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare.
Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more
severe type of plague called Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague – or lung-based plague – is the most
virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any

e8e3b335-8f0f-44ca-bd6c-1cedcfff91cd,What are the different types of skin cancer?,"Non-melanoma skin cancersNon-melanoma skin cancers comprise basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. These are rarely lethal but surgical treatment is painful and often disfiguring. The temporal trends of the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers are difficult to determine, because reliable registration of these cancers has not been achieved. However, specific studies carried out in Australia, Canada and the United States, indicate that between the 1960s and the 1980s the prevalence of non-melanoma skin cancers increased by a factor of more than two.The risk of non-melanoma skin cancers has been examined with respect to personal exposure, and the following conclusions can be drawn:Non-melanoma skin cancers are most frequent on parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck and forearms. This implies that long-term, repeated UV radiation exposure is a major causal factor.Within some countries there is a clear relationship between increasing incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers with decreasing latitude, i.e. higher UV radiation levels.Malignant melanomaMalignant melanoma, although far less prevalent than non-melanoma skin cancers, is the major cause of death from skin cancer and is more likely to be reported and accurately diagnosed than non-melanoma skin cancers. Since the early 1970s, malignant melanoma incidence has increased significantly, for example an average 4 per cent every year in the United States. A large number of studies indicate that the risk of malignant melanoma correlates with genetic and personal characteristics, and a person’s UV exposure behaviour. The following is a summary of the main human risk factors:A large number of atypical nevi (moles) is the strongest risk factor for malignant melanoma in fair-skinned populations.Malignant melanoma is more common among people with a pale complexion, blue eyes, and red or fair hair. Experimental studies have demonstrated a lower minimum erythema dose and more prolonged erythema in melanoma patients than in controls.High, intermittent exposure to solar UV appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma.The incidence of malignant melanoma in white populations generally increases with decreasing latitude, with the highest recorded incidence occurring in Australia, where the annual rates are 10 and over 20 times the rates in Europe for women and men respectively.Several epidemiological studies support a positive association with history of sunburn, particularly sunburn at an early age.The role of cumulative sun exposure in the development of malignant melanoma is equivocal. However, malignant melanoma risk is higher in people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancers and of solar keratoses, both of which are indicators of cumulative UV exposure.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)-radiation-and-skin-cancer

One in every three cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer and, according to Skin Cancer Foundation Statistics, one in every five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.As ozone levels are depleted, the atmosphere loses more and more of its protective filter function and more solar UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface. It is estimated that a 10 per cent decrease in ozone levels will result in an additional 300,000 non-melanoma and 4,500 melanoma skin cancer cases. The global incidence of melanoma continues to increase – however, the main factors that predispose to the development of melanoma seem to be connected with recreational exposure to the sun and a history of sunburn.

However, they should be used in combination with other methods such as sun avoidance and clothing. Remember that the aim of applying sunscreen is not to prolong your stay in the sun, but to protect the exposed parts of your body that are most at risk of getting damaged when you are out in the sun.Sunscreens may contain physical or chemical barriers against the sun's rays. While physical barriers reflect or scatter the UV rays, chemical barriers act by absorbing the UV radiation before it hits the skin. Today's sunscreens filter UV radiation in the UVA and the UVB range. The common SPF label on the tube stands for sun protection factor, a measure of how much UVB the sunscreen can block. The numbers range from 2 upwards.

To achieve good protection: Apply the sunscreen thickly and evenly to all exposed parts of your body 15 minutes before going outside. Pay particular attention to the most exposed parts such as ears, nose, forehead and neck. You should re-apply the sunscreen every two hours, especially after swimming or other sporting activities. The use of a lip balm containing a sunscreen protects against recurrent lip eruptions of cold sores.A number of studies have shown that the vast majority of people do not apply sufficient amounts of sunscreen and therefore do not achieve the specified SPF. Approximately 35 ml of sunscreen must be applied to the total body surface of an adult to result in the SPF quoted on the tube. Hence as a rough guideline, one tube of sunscreen should last for approximately three whole-body applications. It is better to apply too much sunscreen than too little.Sunscreens are not to be confused with after-sun creams.

In contrast to sunscreen lotion, clothing is relatively cheap and does not rub off. Cool, loose-fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat are the essentials for your summer sun protection kit. However, even through a garment, photodamage can occur. Against common belief, the simple see-through test is not good enough to assess the effectiveness of UV protective clothing and often turns out to be a pitfall. Clothing design, the type and structure of the fabric, its colour and tightness and whether the garment is wet or dry determine its effectiveness in protecting against UV radiation.Less UV passes through tightly woven or knitted fabrics.Darker colours usually block more UV radiation.Heavier weight fabrics usually block more UV radiation than lighter fabrics of the same type.Garments that are over-stretched, wet or worn out may lose some of their UV protection properties.Special UVA and UVB absorber additives applied during laundry can significantly improve protection.Over the past few years the concept of a so-called Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) has been introduced, and in some countries manufacturers include the UPF with their garment labelling. The UPF is a measure of the protection against UV radiation provided by an item of clothing, and is the equivalent of the sun protection factor or SPF for sunscreens. The higher the UPF value, the less UV radiation reaches the skin and the better the protection against sunburn and other harmful effects.

870b86ca-94c0-4196-93f6-4f4e064ee47d,Do UVA and UVB affect the body in different ways?,"The skinUVA activates melanin pigment already present in the upper skin cells. It creates a tan that appears quickly but is also lost quickly. Furthermore, UVA penetrates into the deeper skin layers, where connective tissue and blood vessels are affected. As a result the skin gradually loses its elasticity and starts to wrinkle. Therefore, large doses of UVA cause premature ageing. Furthermore, recent studies strongly suggest that it may enhance the development of skin cancers. The mechanisms of this UVA damage are not fully understood, but a popular hypothesis assumes that UVA increases oxidative stress in the cell.UVB stimulates the production of new melanin, which leads to a heavy increase in the dark-coloured pigment within a few days. This tan may last a relatively long time. UVB also stimulates the cells to produce a thicker epidermis. Therefore, UVB is responsible both for the darkening and thickening of the outer cell layers – these reactions are the body's defence against further UV damage.However, higher doses of UVB cause sunburn which increases your likelihood of developing cancer. The exact mechanism of how UVB initiates or promotes cancer is not yet known. In people suffering from Xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare pigmentation disease, the ability to repair DNA damage caused by exposure to UV radiation is impaired. The much-increased rates of skin cancer in these patients suggest that direct UV damage of DNA may be the mechanism that links exposure to the development of cancer.The eyeAs with effects on the skin, the various incoming sun rays penetrate the eye to different depths. While UVB is fully absorbed by the cornea, UVA passes through these surface layers to the lens. Among adults only 1 per cent or less of incoming UV radiation reaches the retina because of the filter function of cornea and lens. In contrast visible light easily penetrates through to the retina, where it activates photoreceptors and starts the chain reaction of biochemical processes to produce a visible image.The immune systemMost experiments to date have concentrated on UVB, as it appears to be more important than UVA in causing immunemodulation. However, recently the interest in the effects of UVA on the immune system has been growing. It is believed that UV radiation is absorbed by a molecule located in the skin. This leads to changes in the distribution and activity of some of the key molecular and cellular players of the immune system. An altered balance of the immune response through cells and antibodies may reduce the body's ability to defend itself against certain diseases.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation
7897f2f0-0bc1-440f-95d8-3adf3f190f0f,Are there beneficial effects of UV radiation?,"The sun's rays provide warmth and light that enhance your general feeling of well-being and stimulate blood circulation. Some UV radiation is essential to the body as it stimulates the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D has an important function in increasing calcium and phosphorus absorption from food and plays a crucial role in skeletal development, immune function and blood cell formation. There is no doubt that a little sunlight is good for you! But 5 to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure of hands, face and arms two to three times a week during the summer months is sufficient to keep your vitamin D levels high. Closer to the equator, where UV levels are higher, even shorter periods of exposure suffice.Hence, for most people, vitamin D deficiency is unlikely. Possible exceptions are those who have very limited sun exposure such as the housebound elderly, or those with heavily pigmented skin who live in high-latitude countries where UV levels are relatively low. Recognising the need for vitamin D, many countries have introduced supplements into common food like flour, cereals and milk. Naturally occurring vitamin D is very rare in our diet, it is present mainly in fatty fish and cod liver oil.UV radiation has been used to successfully treat a number of diseases, including rickets, psoriasis, eczema and jaundice. This therapeutic use cannot eliminate the negative side-effects of UV radiation but treatment takes place under medical supervision to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks.RicketsRickets causes a child's bones to soften because they are not getting enough calcium. One common reason for this is a lack of vitamin D. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption from food and transports the ion from the gut into the bone. UV radiation exposure stimulates the production of vitamin D. However, today, most people receive enough vitamin D from supplements in the food they eat.Lupus vulgarisLupus vulgaris is tuberculosis of the skin. It used to be common especially in northern Europe during the winter. The disease produces large ulcers on the face and neck, which are difficult to cure and often leave bad scars. A Danish doctor called Neils Finzen developed a UVB lamp that was so successful in curing the disease that it won him the Nobel prize in 1903. Today, Lupus is very rare and is usually treated successfully with antibiotics.PsoriasisPsoriasis is a disease which produces sores and scaling of the skin. It affects 2 to 3 per cent of the population and is probably an autoimmune disease; a disease where your immune system attacks your own cells. Among the treatments for psoriasis PUVA therapy is one of the most popular and successful. The patient is given a drug called psoralen to make the skin more sensitive to UV and is subsequently exposed to UVA radiation. This is repeated several times in the course of treatment. Unfortunately, PUVA treatment increases the patient's risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.VitiligoVitiligo is a patchy loss of skin pigmentation caused by destruction of the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It is probably an autoimmune disease and can be treated by PUVA therapy. In PUVA treatment, the patient is given a drug called psoralen to make the skin more sensitive to UV and is subsequently exposed to UVA radiation. The therapy is fairly successful but increases the patient's risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.Despite these important roles and medical applications, the harmful effects of exposure to UV radiation usually far outweigh its benefits. In addition to the well-known short-term effects of overexposure to the sun such as sunburn or allergic reactions, long-term effects pose a life-long hazard to your health. Overexposure to UV radiation affects your skin, your eyes and probably your immune system. Many people forget that the effects of exposure to UV radiation accumulate over a lifetime. Your sun exposure behaviour now determines your chances of developing skin cancer or cataracts later in life!

47e46b26-fe54-4947-a07b-4f71d67af1cf,What are the effects of UV on the skin?,"The truth about a suntanThere is no such thing as a healthy tan! The skin produces a dark-coloured pigment, melanin, as a shield against further damage from UV radiation. The darkening provides some protection against sunburn: a dark tan on a white skin offers a sun protection factor of between 2 and 4. However, it is no defence against long-term UV damage such as skin cancer. A suntan may be cosmetically desirable, but in fact it is nothing but a sign that your skin has been damaged and has attempted to protect itself.There are two distinct types of tanning reaction: immediate pigment darkening occurs, where the pigment called melanin already present in the skin darkens on exposure to UVA. This immediate tan begins to fade within a few hours after cessation of exposure. Delayed tanning happens over a period of about three days, when new melanin is produced and distributed between the upper skin cells. This tan can persist for several weeks.SunburnHigh doses of UV radiation kill most of the skin cells in the upper skin layer, and cells that are not killed get damaged. In its mildest form, sunburn consists of a reddening of the skin called erythema. This appears shortly after UV radiation exposure and reaches a maximum intensity between 8 and 24 hours. It then fades over the course of a few days. However, a strong sunburn may cause the skin to blister and peel, which is not only painful but also leaves the very white and new skin underneath unprotected and even more prone to UV damage.PhotosensitivityA small percentage of the population have a skin condition that makes them particularly sensitive to the sun's UV rays. A minimal dose of UV radiation is sufficient to trigger an allergic reaction leading to rash or severe sunburn. Photosensitivity is often associated with the use of certain medications, including some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers, tranquillizers, oral anti-diabetics, antibiotics and antidepressants. If you take any medication on a regular basis, please refer to the package insert for the product or consult your health care provider about possible photosensitivity reactions. Some foods and cosmetic products like fragrances and soaps may also contain ingredients that cause or aggravate the photosensitivity condition.The wrinkle factorSun exposure promotes the ageing of your skin due to a combination of several factors. UVB stimulates cell proliferation in the outer layer of the skin. As more and more cells are produced the epidermis thickens. UVA penetrating into the deeper skin layers disturbs the connective tissue: the skin gradually loses its elasticity. Wrinkles, sags and bags are the common result of this loss of elasticity. A phenomenon often seen in elderly people is the localized over-production of melanin resulting in dark patches or liver spots. Furthermore, the sun's rays dry out your skin making it coarse and leathery.Non-melanoma skin cancersIn contrast to malignant melanoma, the non-melanoma skin cancers basal and squamous cell carcinoma are not usually fatal but surgical treatment can be painful and result in scars. Non-melanoma skin cancers are most frequent on those parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck and forearms. The finding that they are more frequent in outdoor than in indoor workers suggests that the accumulated life-time exposure to UV radiation plays a major role in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers.Basal cell carcinomas are the most common type of skin cancer. Their reported incidence has drastically increased over the past two decades and continues to rise. They usually appear as a red lump or scaly area, however, no clear precursors have been identified. They grow slowly, rarely spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) and can be removed surgicallySquamous cell carcinomas are the second most common form of skin cancer. They appear as a thickened red scaly spot at body sites most often exposed to UV radiation. As they sometimes metastasize they are more dangerous than basal cell carcinomas. However, they also tend to be slow growing and can usually be removed surgically before they become a serious risk.Melanoma skin cancersMalignant melanoma is the rarest but most dangerous type of skin cancer. It is one of the most common cancers among 20- to 35-year-olds, especially in Australia and New Zealand. All forms of skin cancer have been on the increase over the past twenty years, however, the highest rate of increase worldwide is noted for malignant melanoma.Malignant melanomaMalignant melanoma may arise as a new mole or as changes in colour, shape, size or sensation of an old spot, freckle or mole. Melanomas tend to have an irregular outline and a patchy colouring. Itching is another common symptom but is also found in normal moles. If recognized and treated early, the chances of survival are good. If untreated, the tumour can develop rapidly, and cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body.The causes of malignant melanoma are not fully understood. Exposure during childhood is thought to be more important than exposure later in life. Tumour development may be linked to occasional exposure to short periods of intense sunlight, such as at weekends or on holiday. The higher incidence of malignant melanoma in indoor workers compared to outdoor workers supports that notion.Watch out for early symptoms of malignant melanomaIf you have a mole, freckle or spot you are concerned about, go and see a dermatologist! It may well not be a melanoma; however, if it is a melanoma, it is crucial that it is recognized and treated early.Check regularly for any mole that grows, changes shape or colour, is inflamed or itchy, weeps or bleed",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation
82205b43-ca1c-4988-9f2d-3f94e3738fe4,What are the effects of UV on the eye?,"The eye occupies less than 2 per cent of the whole body surface area, but it represents the sole organ system to allow the penetration of visible light deep into the human body. During human evolution a number of mechanisms have evolved to protect this very sensitive organ against harmful effects of the sun's rays:The eye is recessed within the anatomy of the head and shielded well by the brow ridge, the eyebrows and the eyelashes. However, these anatomical adaptations are of limited use in UV protection under extreme conditions such as sunbed use or strong ground reflection from snow, water and sand.Constriction of the pupil, closure of the eyelids and the squinting reflex minimize the penetration of the sun's rays into the eye. These mechanisms are activated by bright visible light and not by UV radiation – but on a cloudy day UV radiation exposure may still be high. Therefore, the effectiveness of these natural defences in protecting against UV damage is limited.Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitisPhotokeratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, while photoconjunctivitis refers to an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and eye socket. These inflammatory reactions may be compared to a sunburn of the very sensitive skin-like tissues of the eyeball and eyelids and usually appear within a few hours of exposure. Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis can be very painful, however, they are reversible and do not seem to result in any long-term damage to the eye or vision.An extreme form of photokeratitis is snow blindness. It sometimes occurs in skiers and climbers who experience extreme UV levels due to high altitude conditions and very strong ground reflection – fresh snow can reflect up to 80 per cent of incident UV radiation. These extreme UV levels kill the outer cells of the eyeball leading to blindness. Snow blindness is very painful when the dead cells are being shed. In the majority of cases new cells grow quickly and vision is restored within a few days. Very severe snow blindness may involve complications such as chronic irritations or tearing.PterygiumThis growth of the conjunctiva on the surface of the eye is a common cosmetic blemish and is probably linked to prolonged UV exposure. Pterygium may extend over the centre of the cornea and thereby reduce vision. It also has a tendency to become inflamed. Even though it can be removed by surgery, the outgrowth tends to recur.CataractsCataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world. Proteins in the eye's lens unravel, tangle and accumulate pigments which cloud the lens and eventually lead to blindness. Even though cataracts appear to different degrees in most individuals as they age, they appear to be enhanced by exposure to UVB. Cataracts can be surgically removed and an artificial lens or other means of optical correction can restore vision.Every year some 16 million people in the world suffer from blindness due to a loss of transparency in the lens. WHO estimates suggest that up to 20 per cent of cataracts may be caused by overexposure to UV radiation and are therefore avoidable.Cancer of the eyeCurrent scientific evidence suggests that different forms of eye cancer may be associated with life-long exposure to the sun. Melanoma is the most frequent malignant cancer of the eyeball and sometimes requires surgical removal. A common location for basal cell carcinoma is on the eyelids.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation

Of 38 patients, who recurrently suffer from Herpes simplex infections, 27 developed cold sores after exposure to UV radiation. In contrast, after the application of protective sunscreen, none of the patients developed cold sores. Therefore, beyond limiting skin-damaging effects, sunscreen may be effective in the prevention of sunlight-induced recurrent eruptions.Research in recent years has provided increasing evidence that exposure to environmental UV levels can alter the activity and distribution of some of the cells responsible for triggering immune responses in humans. As a consequence sun exposure may enhance risk of infection or reduce the body's defences against skin cancer. Especially in countries of the developing world, high UV levels may decrease the effectiveness of vaccinations.It has also been suggested that UV radiation may promote cancer in two distinct ways: by directly inducing DNA damage and by weakening the immune system. To date little research has been undertaken to describe the potential influence of immunomodulation on the development of cancer.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation

It is particularly important to prevent, predict, detect, and respond to global health threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic.The approach mobilizes multiple sectors, disciplines and communities at varying levels of society to work together. This way, new and better ideas are developed that address root causes and create long-term, sustainable solutions.One Health involves the public health, veterinary, public health and environmental sectors. The One Health approach is particularly relevant for food and water safety, nutrition, the control of zoonoses (diseases that can spread between animals and humans,
such as flu, rabies and Rift Valley fever), pollution management, and combatting antimicrobial resistance (the emergence of microbes that are resistant to antibiotic therapy).To view more related questions and answers, click here.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/one-health

WHO is also working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as a One Health Quadripartite. The Quadripartite is promoting multi-sectoral approaches to reduce health threats at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. The transformations required to prevent and mitigate the impact of current and future health challenges at global, regional and country levels is outlined in the Quadripartite One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA).The One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP) was formed in May 2021 to advise FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH on One Health issues. This includes recommendations for research on emerging disease threats, and the development of a long-term global plan of action to avert outbreaks of diseases like H5N1 avian influenza, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and, possibly, COVID-19.The panel will also have a role in investigating the impact of human activity on the environment and wildlife habitats, and how this drives disease threats. Critical areas include food production and distribution, urbanization and infrastructure development, international travel and trade, activities that lead to biodiversity loss and climate change, and those that put increased pressure on the natural resource base – all of which can lead to the emergence of zoonotic diseases.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/one-health

6fef612b-66e4-4b06-a645-f45efec1f729,What is antimicrobial resistance?,"Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms such as
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the
medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the
microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often
referred to as “superbugs”. This is a major concern because a resistant
infection may kill, can spread to others, and imposes huge costs to
individuals and society.
Antimicrobial resistance is the broader term for resistance in
different types of microorganisms and encompasses resistance to
antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal drugs. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally but is facilitated
by the inappropriate use of medicines, for example using antibiotics for
viral infections such as cold or flu, or sharing antibiotics.
Low-quality medicines, wrong prescriptions and poor infection prevention
and control also encourage the development and spread of drug
resistance. Lack of government commitment to address these issues, poor
surveillance and a diminishing arsenal of tools to diagnose, treat and
prevent also hinder the control of antimicrobial drug resistance.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/antimicrobial-resistance
08857a15-643b-4a24-86b4-402ff6ddbd7a,Does stopping a course of antibiotics early lead to antibiotic resistance?,"There has been a lot of research into how long antibiotic
courses should be, to determine the shortest possible length of course
needed to completely kill all bacteria.
If you are being treated for an infection, the kind of
antibiotics your doctor prescribes and the length of the course should
be based on the best evidence.Feeling better, or an improvement in symptoms, does not always
mean that the infection has completely gone. Your doctor has had years
of training and has access to the latest evidence – so always follow
their advice. Evidence is emerging that shorter courses of antibiotics may
be just as effective as longer courses for some infections. Shorter
treatments make more sense – they are more likely to be completed
properly, have fewer side effects and also likely to be cheaper. They
also reduce the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, thereby reducing
the speed by which the pathogen develops resistance. WHO publishes guidelines about treatments for different
infections and recommends treatment durations and doses of antibiotics
based on the best clinical evidence for each case. We continuously
review the latest research so that we can provide updated
recommendations to health professionals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/antimicrobial-resistance

c65ba4ea-d63c-41c8-9e50-3c78042e5604,What are the main findings?,"The SDG Health Price Tag models two scenarios: an ""ambitious""
scenario in which countries reach the health targets in the SDGs by
2030, and a “progress” scenario in which countries get two thirds or
more of the way to the targets.In both scenarios, health systems investments such as
employing more health workers; building and operating new clinics,
hospitals and laboratories; and buying medical equipment account for
about 75% of the total cost. The remainder is for medicines, vaccines,
syringes and other commodities used to prevent or treat specific
diseases, and for activities such as training, health campaigns and
outreach to vulnerable communities.Under the ""ambitious"" scenario, achieving the SDG health
targets would require new investments increasing over time from an
initial US$ 134 billion annually to $371 billion, or $58 per person, by
2030.The model includes adding more than 23 million health workers,
and building more than 415 000 new health facilities, 91% of which
would be primary health care centres.The investments could prevent 97 million premature deaths –
one every five seconds over 15 years – including more than 50 million
infants and children who are either stillborn or die before their fifth
birthday, and 20 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Life expectancy would
increase by between 3.1 and 8.4 years, and 535 million years of healthy
living would be added across the 67 countries.The ""progress"" scenario would require new investments
increasing from an initial US$ 104 billion a year to $274 billion, or
$41 per person, by 2030. These investments would prevent about 71
million premature deaths, add more than 14 million new health workers,

61cf8dcb-b668-407f-9429-b83f05fa7e58,Can countries afford it?,"Yes, most can. WHO analysis shows that 85% of the costs can be
met with domestic resources, although as many as 32 of the world’s
poorest countries will face an annual gap of up to US$ 54 billion and
will continue to need external assistance.Investments made under the ambitious scenario would boost
health spending as a proportion of gross domestic product across all 67
countries from an average of 5.6% to 7.5%. The progress scenario would
boost health spending as a proportion of GDP to an average of 6.5%. The
global average for health spending as a proportion of GDP is 9.9%.
Although higher spending does not necessarily translate to improved
health, making the right investments at the right time can.WHO encourages countries to set nationally appropriate
spending targets for quality investments in essential public services in
the health sector as well as other social sectors, consistent with
national sustainable development strategies.Governments can generate more public revenue by broadening the
tax base, increasing the efficiency of tax collection, and reducing
corruption and international tax avoidance. Parallel to this,
governments should also ensure that an appropriate share of public
revenue is allocated to health.However, it’s not only how much is spent but how
it’s spent. At the same level of spending, WHO observes a significant
variance in health system performance across countries due to differing
levels of efficiency.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag

disease burden, health service coverage, and health system performance.
We grouped countries into five categories in terms of their health
systems and financial capacity.We considered how health services could be scaled up through
four categories of health service delivery from policy and community
interventions like taxes and regulations up to hospital services. Next,
we identified what investments are needed to bring countries towards
global benchmarks in terms of health system performance targets, health
service coverage, and overall health outcomes. These activities and
investments are modelled by country and by year, and multiplied by
country-specific prices. Investments are modelled to increase over time.

uncertainty around the size of future gains and when those will happen.
Moreover, while future technologies may be more cost-effective, they
also may be more expensive and require additional resources than what we
have modelled. Given the uncertainty, we did not attempt to model a
forecasted change in technology whereby more effective technologies are

Using unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names is one way to prevent identities from being inadvertently disclosed. Another is “geo-masking”—that preserves vital information on the spatial distribution of cases but does not pinpoint exactly where the clusters of cases are.

98e7dde8-8645-403d-a568-24f4515c319c,"What kind of vaccine is WHO asking for, and for whom?","In emergencies, we focus on the prevention of the most devastating disease manifestation which, in
the context of Zika, is congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This is a condition occurring in newborns and
infants who were exposed to Zika virus infection in utero. For this reason, the priority population to
protect through vaccination is women of childbearing age so that when pregnant they do not
become infected with Zika virus.Because women of childbearing age may include women who are unknowingly pregnant, or even
knowingly pregnant depending on the risk of disease and the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine,
WHO’s preference is for non-replicating platforms with no documented safety concerns from use
during pregnancy, such as inactivated whole, subunit based and those that use alum as adjuvant. It is
also anticipated that these vaccines, which already have licensed vaccines in their class, would be
faster to license by a regulatory authority than a novel vaccine platform. However, it is considered
important that there be no contraindication for use during pregnancy or in lactating women, and the
vaccine should be safe and effective regardless of prior flavivirus exposure.However, the TPP also outlines minimal criteria for a vaccine that support development of other
platforms, such as DNA/RNA vaccine platforms, viral vectored vaccines, and new adjuvants. These
products may also have favourable characteristics with respect to production capabilities or duration
of protection. If, when a vaccine becomes available, vaccine supply is limited, then vaccine will be prioritized for
women of child-bearing age. However, there are good reasons to vaccinate males as well, such as to
prevent sexual transmission, and should vaccine supply not be limited, males of the same ages
should also be included in the target population. Depending on the vaccine candidate and the risk of
disease, off-label vaccination of pregnant women could be considered by public health agencies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile
8d5d7920-05eb-4b0b-b7ea-e78ed70ca60d,Does WHO discourage development of other platforms/approaches?,"No. It is not WHO’s intent to discourage development of replication competent approaches, or novel
platforms for ZIKV vaccine development. These may be critical tools for the prevention of Zika
outside the current outbreak context. For example, if ZIKV is or becomes a disease transmitted at
younger ages, a vaccine platform may be prioritized that induces long-term, even life-long durability
to protect women during their child-bearing years. Live, replicating platforms are likely to be
prioritized in this scenario. Thus, investments in a wide range of platforms, even those that do not
meet all preferred criteria in the WHO TPP, are strongly encouraged.WHO is committed to supporting vaccine development and innovative approaches. In the WHO
Mission and Vision for 2015-2030, WHO outlines three strategic directions to support product
development:Promote the development of new vaccines and vaccine delivery technologies to meet public
health priorities,Establish norms and standards for vaccines and delivery technologies, andEnsure vaccines and delivery technologies are of assured quality.WHO will continue to support activities to meet these directions across public health priority

through the protection of pregnant women against Zika virus infection. However, this value
proposition is different than what is expected in the clinical development program and indication.It is preferred that vaccine candidates demonstrate vaccine efficacy of at least 80% against
virologically-confirmed ZIKV illness, or even against infection if this can be adequately measured. If
vaccine efficacy cannot be measured due to lack of ZIKV transmission, and if a surrogate of immunity
is established through animal models or cohort studies, this could be sufficient to warrant use of the
vaccine. Pending study approval by regulatory authorities, data from a human challenge model may
complement immunogenicity data.It is expected that vaccine prevention of CZS and GBS can be demonstrated only in post-licensure

characterize whether endemic transmission is occurring in various parts of the world, it is possible
that Zika circulation could mimic something like Rubella, in which childhood vaccination could be
envisaged as a way to increase population and long-term protection of females to prevent cases of
CZS.There are currently insufficient data to inform a TPP for routine/endemic use. If and when sufficient

6e32bdc0-d02d-43c2-b592-5b2897f9b37e,What is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?,"The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is
an international treaty designed by countries as the most powerful tool
to reduce the health and economic burden caused by tobacco. It entered
into force in 2005, and implementation of the Convention is called for
in target 3.a of the Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO FCTC is one
of the most rapidly embraced treaties in the history of the United
Nations.
There are 180 Parties to the Convention, which is legally
binding, meaning that Parties are required to take incremental action to
prevent tobacco consumption, marketing and exposure, among many other
measures. The Convention contains core demand- and supply-reduction
provisions of proven effectiveness and calls for enhanced international
cooperation. It also requires Parties to protect their tobacco control
and public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of
the tobacco industry.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-and-the-who-framework-convention-on-tobacco-control

complex international phenomena have led to the globalization of the
tobacco epidemic. As the epidemic transcends national borders, its
control requires international cooperation and multilateral regulation.
The WHO FCTC was developed as a global response to the
globalization of the tobacco epidemic. There is no doubt that reducing
the rates of uptake and consumption of tobacco will save lives and that
the WHO FCTC is the evidence-based tool with which to do it.By becoming Parties and implementing the provisions of the WHO
FCTC where it counts most – at the country level – countries are
working towards a tobacco-free world and towards millions of lives

881f77c0-74e8-4dea-a5f7-a3f1a9352c00,What is contact tracing and why is it important?,"People in close contact with someone who is infected with a
virus, such as the Ebola virus, are at higher risk of becoming infected
themselves, and of potentially further infecting others. Closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected
person will help the contacts to get care and treatment, and will
prevent further transmission of the virus.This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into 3 basic steps:Contact identification: Once someone is confirmed as
infected with a virus, contacts are identified by asking about the
person’s activities and the activities and roles of the people around
them since onset of illness. Contacts can be anyone who has been in
contact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues,
friends, or health care providers.Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact
with the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be
made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their
contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the
importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts
should also be provided with information about prevention of the
disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high
risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital. Contact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/contact-tracing

is helping Member States, laboratories, industry, and civil society work
together to better prepare the world for an influenza pandemic.The PIP Framework was set up to introduce greater equity and
solidarity among nations when the next pandemic strikes. The best
defense against influenza is vaccination. However, many countries do not
have the capacity to develop vaccines on their own, relying instead on
products manufactured by others. Moreover, with current technologies,
producing a safe and efficacious vaccine requires at least 4–6 months
from the time a virus emerges. Even then production will take time –
therefore, each dose that will become available will be precious. Under the PIP Framework, WHO will have real-time access to
approximately 10% of global vaccine production and will be able to send
life-saving doses to developing countries in need. In this manner, all
countries – whether rich or poor – will have access to some vaccine at
the same time.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework
908d1c0e-f4b6-4356-89c6-1af8ad9f8adc,How does the PIP Framework work?,"The PIP Framework has two goals that are pursued on an equal footing, promoting: the sharing of influenza viruses that could cause a pandemic, and access to capacity-development and products such as vaccines. Influenza viruses are shared through the Global Influenza
Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a network of more than 150
public health laboratories located around the world. In addition to
serving as a virus sharing platform, GISRS also shares genetic sequence
data derived from these viruses, develops and shares reagents, and
undertakes risk assessments. One of its critical functions is to develop
candidate vaccine viruses, which are used by manufacturers to develop
vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza.In exchange for receiving influenza viruses with pandemic
potential and associated data from GISRS, manufacturers contribute to
pandemic preparedness in two ways: they pay an annual Partnership
Contribution (totaling US$ 28 million) to WHO, and they agree, under
legally binding contracts, to provide vaccines, antivirals, diagnostic
kits or other products to WHO at the time of the next pandemic .",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework

viruses that have the potential to cause a pandemic. A pandemic virus may develop from a mutated seasonal virus.
The laboratory detection and analysis capacity required for seasonal
viruses is the same as that required for detecting a potentially
pandemic virus. Also, the capacity to produce a pandemic vaccine depends
on robust seasonal vaccine production – in a pandemic, manufacturers
will use the same seasonal vaccine production facilities to produce the
pandemic vaccine.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework

27410462-62c2-468c-8434-e65ee8c138d0,What is vaccine-derived polio?,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened)
vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child
is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the
intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building
up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In
areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread
in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other
children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out.
On rare occasions, if a population is seriously
under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for
an extended period of time. The longer it is allowed to survive, the
more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the
vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse –
this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus
(cVDPV).It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the
strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized
population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur
when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly
conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether
from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with
the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is
fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and
wild polioviruses.Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been
administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more
than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has
been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks
occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2
component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2
already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was
implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization
programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated
with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the
risk of cases of cVDPV2. The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the
tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year,
hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented.
Well over 10 million cases have been averted since large-scale
administration of OPV began 20 years ago.Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with
2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the
same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with
the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of
the virus.Fact sheet on vaccine-derived poliovirus published by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PDF)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/poliomyelitis-vaccine-derived-polio

SAGE and MPAC were not supportive of vaccine use among infants aged 6–12 weeks due to the lower efficacy seen in this age group.SAGE/MPAC recommended large-scale implementation pilots, to evaluate the extent to which the protection demonstrated in children aged 5–17 months in the Phase 3 trial can be replicated in the context of the routine health system, particularly in view of the need for a 4-dose schedule that requires new immunization contacts.The pilot implementation should also assess the extent to which RTS,S vaccination impacts mortality, which could not be adequately assessed in the Phase 3 trial due to the very low overall mortality in the trial setting, and whether the excess cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria, identified during the Phase 3 trial, are causally related to RTS,S vaccination or not. The pilot implementation programme will generate critical evidence in 3–5 years’ time to enable decision-making about the potential wider scale use of this vaccine.WHO officially adopted the SAGE/MPAC recommendations in January 2016 and is strongly supportive of the need to proceed with these pilots as the next step for the RTS,S malaria vaccine.WHO position paper on malaria vaccinepdf, 536kb",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01

Microcephaly happens when there is either a problem in utero, causing the baby’s brain to stop growing properly, or after birth when the head stops growing properly. Children born with microcephaly often have developmental challenges as they grow older. In some cases, children with microcephaly develop entirely normally. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors such as Down syndrome; exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; and rubella infection during pregnancy.Fact sheet on microcephalySurveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndromeScreening, assessment and management of neonates and infants with complications associated with Zika virus exposure in utero",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/zika

WHO encourages affected countries and their partners to scale up the use of current mosquito control interventions as the most immediate line of defence. WHO recommends approaches that tackle all life stages of the Aedes mosquito, from the egg, to the larva/pupa to the adult.Current interventions include: targeted residual spraying of adult Aedes mosquitoes in and around houses; space spraying/indoor fogging where Aedes mosquitoes rest and bite and outside; elimination of Aedes mosquito larvae in standing water breeding sites and personal protection from mosquito bites. If current methods are implemented in an expedient, comprehensive and sustained way, with community participation, along with other measures, mosquito control can be effective. In addition, WHO encourages countries and their partners to judiciously test new control tools that could potentially be applied in the future.WHO's vector control recommendations targeting the Aedes species are also very efficient against other mosquito vectors. The range of methods for reducing mosquitos include spraying the inside walls of houses, indoor space spraying, larval control and eliminating breeding sites.

The disease cannot be spread by contact from one person to another.Mosquitoes breed in tropical rainforests, humid, and semi-humid environments, as well as around bodies of still water in and close to human habitations in urban settings. Increased contact between humans and infected mosquitoes, particularly in urban areas where people have not been vaccinated for yellow fever, can create epidemics.Outbreaks of the disease are of particular concern when they occur in overcrowded settings with inadequate water supply and waste management services that allow the mosquitoes to breed easily.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/yellow-fever

Symptoms usually present themselves in 2 phases.The first, ""acute"", phase usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve and their symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.However, a small percentage of people enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. They will experience high fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with vomiting and deteriorating kidney function. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, with blood appearing in vomit and faeces.

Doctors or clinicians who see a sick patient may not be able to tell that they have yellow fever from their symptoms alone, especially if they are in an area where many of these diseases are occurring at the same time.To confirm a suspected diagnosis of yellow fever, laboratory tests need to be done. Blood tests can detect antibodies produced in response to yellow fever, proving that the person has been infected or vaccinated.

The best available evidence is used within the appraisal stage of HIA to determine what impacts may occur (both positive and negative), the size of the impact (if possible) and the distribution of that impact in different population groups. It is generally assumed that the evidence for health impacts exists, and that searching and collating will provide the necessary evidence. Unfortunately this is not often the case, and the evidence of health impacts is often not available. This is because of the long causal pathway between the implementation of a project/programme/policy and any potential impact on population health, and the many confounding factors that make the determination of a link difficult. Within the HIA it is important therefore to be explicit about sources of evidence and to identify missing or incomplete information.Providing a comprehensive review of the evidence base is not simple. It needs to draw on the best available evidence – that from reviews and research papers, and including qualitative and quantitative evidence. This information must be supplemented with local and expert knowledge, policy information, and proposal specific information.However, there are examples where the best available evidence has been documented, and in some cases summarised.

which is ingested through drinking contaminated water. The condition is
known as dracunculiasis or guinea-worm disease. The worm eventually
causes a debilitating and painful infection that begins with a blister,
normally on the leg. Around the time of its eruption, the person may
experience itching, fever, swelling, severe pain and a burning
sensation.
Infected people often try to relieve the pain by immersing the
infected part in water. If it is immersed in open water sources such as
ponds and shallow step wells the worm emerges and releases thousands of
larvae. The larva is ingested by a water flea (cyclop), where it
develops and becomes infective in two weeks. When a person drinks the
water, the cyclop is killed by the acidity of the stomach and the larva
is freed and penetrates the gut wall. After about one year, a blister
forms and the mature worm, one metre long, emerges thus repeating the
life-cycle.At the beginning of the 20th century, guinea-worm disease was
widespread in many countries in Africa and Asia. Out of 20 countries
that were endemic worldwide in the early 1980s, only Chad, Ethiopia, and
South Sudan – all from the African continent – are currently endemic.

example, there is an alarming spread of multi-drug resistant
tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In 2015, an estimated 480 000 people were
infected with MDR-TB.Similarly, new vaccines targeting Staphylococcus aureus (which causes skin and soft tissue infections), Klebsiella pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia and infections of the blood stream and urinary tract), Clostridium difficile

understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem”. WHO identifies two main
approaches to pharmacovigilance: spontaneous and active.Spontaneous (or voluntary) reporting means that no active measures are taken to look for adverse
reactions. Reporting to the national authorities responsible for patient safety is entirely dependent on the
initiative and motivation of the reporters, usually health care professionals and sometimes the patients.
This is the most widespread form of pharmacovigilance globally, and in some countries it is mandated by
law. One of the key disadvantages of spontaneous reporting is that it does not allow an estimation of the
occurrence rates of events Active pharmacovigilance means that measures are taken proactively to detect safety concerns. This is
achieved by active monitoring at start of, during and at times after the end of treatment. The events may
be detected by screening patient records, direct questioning of the patients and through laboratory testing
at predefined intervals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)
dd805511-16de-4f77-b070-fe2075fa6241,What is active TB drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM)?,"aDSM defines the active and systematic clinical and laboratory assessment of patients on treatment for
extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), or with new TB medicines or novel regimens for multidrug-resistant TB
(MDR-TB) to detect, manage and report suspected or confirmed drug toxicities. The recording and reporting
activities of aDSM primarily target the serious adverse events (SAEs) as a priority requirement. MDR-TB
treatment sites may also monitor other AEs which are of clinical significance or of special interest to the
programme, as part of comprehensive aDSM.
aDSM is used to monitor and manage adverse events in patients who receive a particular medication or
treatment regimen and to assess causality. It applies the principles of active pharmacovigilance to the specific
needs and context of national TB programmes and is embedded within the patient monitoring function (e.g.
cohort monitoring) of TB programmes. The management of patient safety is an inherent part of aDSM,
inseparable from its monitoring component.
In aDSM, besides the spontaneously reported reactions, adverse events are also elicited as part of a patient
monitoring plan comprising of a set of questions and oftentimes an array of laboratory/clinical tests at defined
periods of time, before, during and after treatment. The records from active TB drug-safety monitoring thus
make it possible to determine the exact number of patients monitored and the extent of exposure to a
medicine; they also enumerate the events related to an exposure, in a similar way to a longitudinal
epidemiological study.
The WHO Global TB Programme (WHO/GTB) therefore convened key technical and funding agencies to a
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland on 28-29 July 2015 to discuss essential requirements for the implementation of
active pharmacovigilance and proper management of adverse events (AEs) when introducing new anti-TB
medicines or novel MDR-TB regimens. The document Framework for implementation of active tuberculosis drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM) reflects the consensus achieved during this meeting and in
subsequent discussions also involving NTP managers of selected countries and the WHO Essential Medicines and

5f1c239a-7323-4fbb-81e3-0581b6d1d92b,Why is WHO recommending aDSM?,"WHO recommended the use of bedaquiline, delamanid and the shorter MDR-TB regimen upon condition of
active drug-safety monitoring(2),(3),(4),(5),(6). This recommendation was supported by the independent experts
who reviewed the information available on safety of bedaquiline and delamanid in the Guideline Development
Group meetings held in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Both of these medicines are still relatively new and only a
limited number of patients have been treated with them. In both cases the decision to grant conditional
marketing approval by stringent drug regulatory authorities prior to the completion of Phase 3 trials took into
account the serious nature of MDR-TB and the unsatisfactory outcomes obtained when regimens composed
solely of older second-line drugs are used. Likewise, the 2016 recommendation for a shorter MDR-TB regimen
preceded the results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of its use. All reasonable measures are thus needed
to ensure that patient safety is monitored alongside the effectiveness of the treatment. In this situation,
spontaneous reporting is not expected to represent an appropriate level of care and more active approaches,
such as aDSM, are considered necessary to improve the early and systematic detection and proper management
of harms. It is also important to collect safety data accurately and undertake causality assessment carefully in
order to ensure that all adverse events are properly investigated and that no premature conclusions are drawn
regarding the attribution of cause. Causality assessment is thus very important.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

1e1ba86d-dae6-4616-afdc-2738d21bb8c9,Are there practical examples of aDSM for TB?,"aDSM is a relatively new concept within the span of monitoring activities of national TB programmes. There is
more experience in resource-limited settings with aDSM in treatment programmes for other diseases, such as
malaria and HIV. A number of countries in Africa and elsewhere have recently introduced active drug-safety
monitoring within cohorts of patients treated with the shorter MDR-TB regimen.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

treatment of XDR-TB, or on novel treatment regimens that differ substantially from those in general use.
Programmes can however opt to use aDSM more extensively and there are recent examples where aDSM has
been successfully used for MDR-TB patients on standard regimens without new medicines, or MDR-TB patients

as-yet unrecognised adverse reactions and drug-drug interactions. The 10,000 figure helps illustrate the point
that when an adverse drug reaction occurs as rarely as once in 2,000-3,000 exposures, only a handful of events
may occur even when large numbers of cases are observed. With a few exceptions, it is not expected that such
numbers accrue in any single country and pooling of data across countries would be needed for a
comprehensive analysis of risk. Sample-size calculation, as is the practice in epidemiological studies, is not being
recommended for aDSM. It is important that health professionals are trained to keep close scrutiny on patients
within an observational study setting to avoid missing rare events. Reporting of SAEs by countries to the global aDSM database established in 2016 will increase the
likelihood that signals of unknown or poorly documented drug-related harms are elicited by analysing pooled
data.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

regimens is to develop a safety profile based on a larger number of observations than now. The policy may
actually need to be changed when much less than 10,000 patients receive the medicine if unexpected safety
concerns emerge.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

Does my programme still need to monitor adverse reactions as intensely as in aDSM?,"Yes. aDSM is important when patients are treated with a medicine for which the drug safety profile is as yet
incomplete. This does not depend on the number of patients enrolled. The best described method to
operationalise active drug-safety monitoring is aDSM. Monitoring needs to be closely associated with early
action to prevent and manage any serious consequences to the individual patient. A national programme should
also strive to capture data in the private sector and public-private partnerships. Similar monitoring is needed for
the shorter MDR-TB regimen.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

unexpected effect of treatment (some of these may actually be beneficial to the patient). It is expected that the
adverse reactions which are already known to be associated with a new medicine or regimen will occur among
the patients treated and these need to be detected early. However, for medicines like bedaquiline and
delamanid, which have only been administered to a relatively limited number of patients, a broader perspective
needs to be applied.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)
e44772a3-e2d8-4bf1-b0c6-cf8ca5b9937b,If a patient gets a reaction how can I tell which medicine is causing it (all MDR-TB patients are having combination TB chemotherapy)?,"The most common adverse reactions to be expected of a medicine are often those which have already been
reported in patients exposed to it and which result from interactions with concomitant medication. Some of
them can be plausibly explained by the pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetics of a medicine.
However, with medicines that have not yet undergone Phase 3 trials, the number of patients exposed to
treatment is relatively low and important adverse reactions may not yet be well characterized. Continued
vigilance for unknown or unrecognised untoward effects is important. When multiple drugs are used, an
important method which is used to assess causality is dechallenge +/- rechallenge (withdrawal +/-
reintroduction), with observation of the clinical effects. In the case of new medicines it is crucial that a causality
assessment is undertaken and the findings communicated prudently, as incorrect attribution of harms to any of
these medicines could lead to irreversible harm to their reputation and even reflex withdrawal from markets,
thus depriving patients of the potential benefits of the medicines.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)
2de19f6d-9807-48d9-85ce-79c456d6fa56,Many MDR-TB patients get mild reactions on treatment. Should NTP and health care providers just focus on the serious adverse events (SAEs)?,"For aDSM, all centres treating eligible patients with new TB medicines or novel MDR-TB regimens require the
Core package that requires reporting of all SAEs. However, proper clinical and laboratory management as well as
detection and treatment of all adverse drug reactions must be in place. All SAEs detected should be reported to
the national authority responsible for pharmacovigilance according to individual country requirements and
should be regularly assessed for causality. In addition to the priority requirement to monitor SAE, M/XDR-TB
treatment sites may also monitor other AEs which are of clinical significance or of special interest to the
programme, as part of comprehensive aDSM. aDSM may also be expanded in a phased approach to eventually
cover TB patients on treatment with any second-line medicines.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)
d08c41cc-1ff9-47cf-ba03-8de2f86fe50e,How do I know that an event is “serious”? Is it the same as a “severe” event?,"Seriousness is a dimension of an event that differs from severity, relating more to the consequences of an
event. A serious event is one which either leads to death or to a life-threatening experience; hospitalization or
prolongation of hospitalization; persistent significant disability; or congenital anomaly. In contrast severity is a
subjective assessment made by the patient and/or the health care professional of the intensity of an event and
relates to its impact on the patient’s activities. Severity is often classified on a three-point scale from “mild”
through “moderate” to “severe”, commonly on the basis of a clinician’s judgement. Practitioners may however
want something less subjective on which to base their classification. There are different scales to classify
severity (such as DAIDS(7), CTCAE(8), and ANRS(9)). Any of these can be used; it is important to note that none
of them have been developed specifically for TB medicines and some adaptations may thus be needed. An
event may be severe but not serious, or vice versa, or both: most commonly they are neither.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

bedaquiline and delamanid may be used in a subset of MDR-TB patients who are at an even higher risk of dying.
Careful examination of serious events in patients on this treatment must thus be done to ascertain the
circumstances leading to death or disability. If the episode cannot be explained by what is known about the
pharmacology of the medicine the manufacturer should be alerted. Programmes need to inform manufacturer
within 24 hours of deaths and serious adverse events occurring in patients on the new medicine. It is important
that any unexpected reaction with a serious or fatal outcome due to a medicine is rapidly identified and
investigated. Equally important is that no hasty conclusions are drawn on causality within a context of very
limited treatment options for a serious condition and where the confidence of patients and health-care
professionals in a potentially life-saving medicine could be irreparably damaged. Programmes should prepare
what to do in the event of a serious episode, including how to communicate it factually and constructively. The
WHO Collaborating Centre in Uppsala, Sweden has produced a comprehensive
publication based on experience from real-life situations which provides helpful instruction on how best to act
under such circumstances(10).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-active-tb-drug-safety-monitoring-and-management-(adsm)

education of patients, the production of data collection materials, and the creation or adaptation of a database
in which to consolidate the data. Once the system is in place, much of the running costs will represent marginal
expenses of an additional surveillance activity albeit the labour costs may be substantial. The total amount will
vary between countries and depends on the number of centres involved. Programmes should obtain technical
advice to cost their specific needs more accurately (the costs can also be calculated using the WHO Planning and Budgeting Tool for TB control activities; programmes should set aside at least USD50,000 to provide for the
initial preparations). The costs for aDSM may be included in a request for funding to the Global Fund under the

treatment. However, two key elements need to be in place so that the essential safety data are collected for all
patients the moment that they are started on regimens containing a new medicine: creation of the standard
data collection materials (e.g. paper or electronic forms; see sample forms); and staff properly
trained to collect the data. The NTP needs to assign someone from the start to coordinate the process, ensure
that the two minimum elements are in place; and develop a protocol and have it approved. In this work, the
person should ideally involve experts from relevant disciplines convened by the NTP to steer aDSM at national
level (this could be one function of the MDR committee or consilium). Local capacity for aDSM needs to be built
within the TB and/or drug-safety monitoring centre over the following months. Table 1 shows how the 8 key
steps for the establishment of aDSM could be addressed in the process of patient recruitment, building upon the
strengths of the framework that NTPs are accustomed to when monitoring their patients for treatment response
and outcomes. There is a substantial amount of additional work that is required to mount and maintain aDSM

safety in TB programmes. While it is important that additional demands for data from both the programme and
the patients are minimised, the essential data elements need to be collected in accordance with the time

fe266d8b-f9c8-4253-a927-86b9b08f98f2,What is health promotion?,"Health promotion enables people to increase control over their
own health. It covers a wide range of social and environmental
interventions that are designed to benefit and protect individual
people’s health and quality of life by addressing and preventing the
root causes of ill health, not just focusing on treatment and cure.
There are 3 key elements of health promotion:1.	Good governance for healthHealth promotion requires policy makers across all government
departments to make health a central line of government policy. This
means they must factor health implications into all the decisions they
take, and prioritize policies that prevent people from becoming ill and
protect them from injuries. These policies must be supported by regulations that match
private sector incentives with public health goals. For example, by
aligning tax policies on unhealthy or harmful products such as alcohol,
tobacco, and food products which are high in salt, sugars and fat with
measures to boost trade in other areas. And through legislation that
supports healthy urbanization by creating walkable cities, reducing air
and water pollution, enforcing the wearing of seat belts and helmets. 2.	Health literacyPeople need to acquire the knowledge, skills and information
to make healthy choices, for example about the food they eat and
healthcare services that they need. They need to have opportunities to
make those choices. And they need to be assured of an environment in
which people can demand further policy actions to further improve their
health. 3.	Healthy cities Cities have a key role to play in promoting good health.
Strong leadership and commitment at the municipal level is essential to
healthy urban planning and to build up preventive measures in
communities and primary health care facilities. From healthy cities
evolve healthy countries and, ultimately, a healthier world.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-promotion
42b67699-efbe-4a8b-ad83-277ab42eb736,What are electromagnetic fields and where do they come from?,"Electric fields are created by differences in voltage: the higher the voltage, the stronger will be the resultant field. Magnetic fields are created when electric current flows: the greater the current, the stronger the magnetic field. An electric field will exist even when there is no current flowing. If current does flow, the strength of the magnetic field will vary with power consumption but the electric field strength will be constant.Natural sources of electromagnetic fieldsElectromagnetic fields are present everywhere in our environment but are invisible to the human eye. Electric fields are produced by the local build-up of electric charges in the atmosphere associated with thunderstorms. The earth's magnetic field causes a compass needle to orient in a North-South direction and is used by birds and fish for navigation.Human-made sources of electromagnetic fieldsBesides natural sources the electromagnetic spectrum also includes fields generated by human-made sources: X-rays are employed to diagnose a broken limb after a sport accident. The electricity that comes out of every power socket has associated low frequency electromagnetic fields. And various kinds of higher frequency radiowaves are used to transmit information – whether via TV antennas, radio stations or mobile phone base stations.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields
9cfcaaf0-a919-4d4e-8944-12cb9c77c6a5,What makes the various forms of electromagnetic fields so different?,"One of the main characteristics which defines an electromagnetic field (EMF) is its frequency or its corresponding wavelength. Fields of different frequencies interact with the body in different ways. One can imagine electromagnetic waves as series of very regular waves that travel at an enormous speed, the speed of light. The frequency simply describes the number of oscillations or cycles per second, while the term wavelength describes the distance between one wave and the next. Hence wavelength and frequency are inseparably intertwined: the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength.A simple analogy should help to illustrate the concept: Tie a long rope to a door handle and keep hold of the free end. Moving it up and then down slowly will generate a single big wave; more rapid motion will generate a whole series of small waves. The length of the rope remains constant, therefore, the more waves you generate (higher frequency) the smaller will be the distance between them (shorter wavelength).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields
450f2eb1-edae-46b2-a661-a9f20ee8ecdf,What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields is not a new phenomenon. However, during the 20th century, environmental exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields has been steadily increasing as growing electricity demand, ever-advancing technologies and changes in social behaviour have created more and more artificial sources. Everyone is exposed to a complex mix of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, from the generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipment, to telecommunications and broadcasting.Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields. For example, nerves relay signals by transmitting electric impulses. Most biochemical reactions from digestion to brain activities go along with the rearrangement of charged particles. Even the heart is electrically active - an activity that your doctor can trace with the help of an electrocardiogram.Low-frequency electric fields influence the human body just as they influence any other material made up of charged particles. When electric fields act on conductive materials, they influence the distribution of electric charges at their surface. They cause current to flow through the body to the ground.Low-frequency magnetic fields induce circulating currents within the human body. The strength of these currents depends on the intensity of the outside magnetic field. If sufficiently large, these currents could cause stimulation of nerves and muscles or affect other biological processes.Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects.Heating is the main biological effect of the electromagnetic fields of radiofrequency fields. In microwave ovens this fact is employed to warm up food. The levels of radiofrequency fields to which people are normally exposed are very much lower than those needed to produce significant heating. The heating effect of radiowaves forms the underlying basis for current guidelines. Scientists are also investigating the possibility that effects below the threshold level for body heating occur as a result of long-term exposure. To date, no adverse health effects from low level, long-term exposure to radiofrequency or power frequency fields have been confirmed, but scientists are actively continuing to research this area.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields
57b7e797-d3c4-4b7c-9836-ba8a9545aa34,Biological effects or health effects? What is a health hazard?,"Biological effects are measurable responses to a stimulus or to a change in the environment. These changes are not necessarily harmful to your health. For example, listening to music, reading a book, eating an apple or playing tennis will produce a range of biological effects. Nevertheless, none of these activities is expected to cause health effects. The body has sophisticated mechanisms to adjust to the many and varied influences we encounter in our environment. Ongoing change forms a normal part of our lives. But, of course, the body does not possess adequate compensation mechanisms for all biological effects. Changes that are irreversible and stress the system for long periods of time may constitute a health hazard.An adverse health effect causes detectable impairment of the health of the exposed individual or of his or her offspring; a biological effect, on the other hand, may or may not result in an adverse health effect.It is not disputed that electromagnetic fields above certain levels can trigger biological effects. Experiments with healthy volunteers indicate that short-term exposure at the levels present in the environment or in the home do not cause any apparent detrimental effects. Exposures to higher levels that might be harmful are restricted by national and international guidelines. The current debate is centred on whether long-term low level exposure can evoke biological responses and influence people's well being.Widespread concerns for healthA look at the news headlines of recent years allows some insight into the various areas of public concern. Over the course of the past decade, numerous electromagnetic field sources have become the focus of health concerns, including power lines, microwave ovens, computer and TV screens, security devices, radars and most recently mobile phones and their base stations.The International EMF ProjectIn response to growing public health concerns over possible health effects from exposure to an ever increasing number and diversity of electromagnetic field sources, in 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a large, multidisciplinary research effort. The International EMF Project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions.Conclusions from scientific researchIn the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.Effects on general healthSome members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies.Effects on pregnancy outcomeMany different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents).CataractsGeneral eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public.Electromagnetic fields and cancerDespite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults.A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues.Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and depressionSome individuals report ""hypersensitivity"" to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure.There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject.The focus of current and future researchMuch effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990's.The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.Key pointsA wide range of environmental influences causes biological effects. 'Biological effect' does not equal 'health hazard'. Special research is needed to identify and measure health hazards.At low frequencies, external electric and magnetic fields induce small circulating currents within the body. In virtually all ordinary environments, the levels of induced currents inside the body are too small to produce obvious effects.The main effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is heating of body tissues.There is no doubt that short-term exposure to very high levels of electromagnetic fields can be harmful to health. Current public concern focuses on possible long-term health effects caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below those required to trigger acute biological responses.WHO's International EMF Project was launched to provide scientifically sound and objective answers to public concerns about possible hazards of low level electromagnetic fields.Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health.The focus of international research is the investigation of possible links between cancer and electromagnetic fields, at power line and radiofrequencies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields
7d2c3cbe-02d3-4a69-9863-110535d5603d,What is the current state of research?,"If electromagnetic fields constitute a health hazard, there will be consequences in all industrialized countries. The public demands concrete answers to the ever more pressing question, whether everyday electromagnetic fields cause adverse health effects. The media often seem to have definitive answers. However, one should judge these reports with caution and take into account that the primary interest of the media is not education. A journalist may select and report a story driven by a range of non-technical reasons: journalists compete with one another for time and space and different journals and newspapers compete for circulation numbers. Novel sensational headlines that are relevant to as many people as possible aid them in achieving these goals - bad news is not only the big news, it is often the only news we hear. The large number of studies which suggest that electromagnetic fields are harmless receive little if any coverage. Science cannot provide a guarantee of absolute safety yet but the development of research is reassuring overall.Different types of studies are neededA mix of studies in different research areas is essential for the evaluation of a potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields. Different types of studies investigate distinct aspects of the problem. Laboratory studies on cells aim to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms that link electromagnetic field exposure to biological effects. They try to identify mechanisms based on molecular or cellular changes that are brought about by the electromagnetic field - such a change would provide clues to how a physical force is converted into a biological action within the body. In these studies, single cells or tissues are removed from their normal living environment which may inactivate possible compensation mechanisms.Another type of study, involving animals, is more closely related to real life situations. These studies provide evidence that is more directly relevant to establishing safe exposure levels in humans and often employ several different field levels to investigate dose-response relationships.Epidemiological studies or human health studies are another direct source of information on long-term effects of exposure. These studies investigate the cause and distribution of diseases in real life situations, in communities and occupational groups. Researchers try to establish if there is a statistical association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the incidence of a specific disease or adverse health effect. However, epidemiological studies are costly. More importantly, they involve measurements on very complex human populations and are difficult to control sufficiently well to detect small effects. For these reasons, scientists evaluate all relevant evidence when deciding about potential health hazards, including epidemiology, animal, and cellular studies.Interpretation of epidemiological studiesEpidemiological studies alone typically cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship, mainly because they detect only statistical associations between exposure and disease, which may or may not be caused by the exposure. Imagine a hypothetical study showing a link between electromagnetic field exposure in electrical workers of the company ""X-Electricity"" and an increased risk of cancer. Even if a statistical association is observed, it could also be due to incomplete data on other factors in the workplace. For example, electrical workers may have been exposed to chemical solvents with the potential to cause cancer. Moreover, an observed statistical association may be due only to statistical effects, or the study itself may have suffered from some problem with its design.Therefore, finding an association between some agent and a specific disease does not necessarily mean that the agent caused the disease. Establishing causality requires that an investigator consider many factors. The case for a cause-and-effect link is strengthened if there is a consistent and strong association between exposure and effect, a clear dose-response relationship, a credible biological explanation, support provided by relevant animal studies, and above all consistency between studies. These factors have generally been absent in studies involving electromagnetic fields and cancer. This is one of the strongest reasons why scientists have generally been reluctant to conclude that weak electromagnetic fields have health effects.Difficulties in ruling out the possibility of very small risks""The absence of evidence of detrimental effects does not seem to suffice in modern society. The evidence of their absence is demanded more and more instead"". (Barnabas Kunsch, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf)""There is no convincing evidence for an adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields"" or ""A cause-effect link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has not been confirmed"" are typical of the conclusions that have been reached by expert committees that have examined the issue. This sounds as if science wanted to avoid giving an answer. Then why should research continue if scientists have already shown that there is no effect?The answer is simple: Human health studies are very good at identifying large effects, such as a connection between smoking and cancer. Unfortunately, they are less able to distinguish a small effect from no effect at all. If electromagnetic fields at typical environmental levels were strong carcinogens, then it would have been easy to have shown that by now. By contrast, if low level electromagnetic fields are a weak carcinogen, or even a strong carcinogen to a small group of people in the larger population, that would be far more difficult to demonstrate. In fact, even if a large study shows no association we can never be entirely sure that there is no relationship. The absence of an effect could mean that there really is none. But just as well it could mean that the effect is simply undetectable with our method of measurement. Therefore, negative results are generally less convincing than strong positive ones.The most difficult situation of all, which unfortunately has developed with epidemiology studies involving electromagnetic fields, is a collection of studies with weak positive results, which however are inconsistent among each other. In that situation, scientists themselves are likely to be divided about the significance of the data. However, for the reasons explained above, most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.What's in the future?The main aim of WHO's International EMF Project is to initiate and co-ordinate research worldwide to produce a well-founded response to public concerns. This evaluation will integrate results from cellular, animal and human health studies to allow as comprehensive a health risk assessment as possible. A holistic assessment of a variety of relevant and reliable studies will provide the most reliable answer possible about the adverse health effects, if any exist, of long term exposure to weak electromagnetic fields.One way to illustrate the necessity of evidence from different types of experiments is a crossword. To be able to read the given crossword's solution with absolute CERTAINTY nine questions must be answered. Assuming we can only answer three of these, we might be able to guess the solution. However, the three given letters may also be part of a very different word. Every additional answer will increase our own confidence. In fact, science will probably never be able to answer all questions, but the more solid evidence we collect the better will be our guess at the solution.Key pointsLaboratory studies on cells aim to determine if there is a mechanism by which electromagnetic field exposure could cause harmful biological effects. Animal studies are essential for establishing effects in higher organisms whose physiology resembles that of humans to a degree. Epidemiological studies look for statistical associations between field exposure and the incidence of specific adverse health outcomes in humans.Finding a statistical association between some agent and a specific disease does not mean that the agent caused the disease.The absence of health effects could mean that there really are none; however, it could also signify that an existing effect is undetectable with present methods.Results of diverse studies (cellular, animal, and epidemiology) must be considered together before drawing conclusions about possible health risks of a suspected environmental hazard. Consistent evidence from these very different types of studies increases the degree of certainty about a true effect",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields
a1cc76b4-3628-4d95-86df-962843c4528d,What are typical exposure levels at home and in the environment?,"Electromagnetic fields at homeBackground electromagnetic field levels from electricity transmission and distribution facilitiesElectricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances
account for the background level of power frequency electric and magnetic fields in the home. In homes not located near power lines this background field may be up to about 0.2 µT. Directly beneath power lines the fields are much stronger. Magnetic
flux densities at ground level can range up to several µT. Electric field levels underneath power lines can be as high as 10 kV/m. However, the fields (both electric and magnetic) drop off with distance from the lines. At 50 m to 100 m distance
the fields are normally at levels that are found in areas away from high voltage power lines. In addition, house walls substantially reduce the electric field levels from those found at similar locations outside the house.Electric appliances in the householdThe strongest power frequency electric fields that are ordinarily encountered in the environment exist beneath high voltage transmission lines. In contrast, the strongest magnetic fields at power frequency are normally found very close to motors and other
electrical appliances, as well as in specialized equipment such as magnetic resonance scanners used for medical imaging.Typical electric field strengths measured near household appliances(at a distance of 30 cm)(From: Federal Office for Radiation Safety, Germany 1999)Electric applianceElectric field strength (V/m)Stereo receiver180Iron120Refrigerator120Mixer100Toaster80Hair dryer80Colour TV60Coffee machine60Vacuum cleaner50Electric oven8Light bulb5  Guideline limit value5000Many people are surprised when they become aware of the variety of magnetic field levels found near various appliances. The field strength does not depend on how large, complex, powerful or noisy the device is. Furthermore, even between apparently
similar devices, the strength of the magnetic field may vary a lot. For example, while some hair dryers are surrounded by a very strong field, others hardly produce any magnetic field at all. These differences in magnetic field strength are related
to product design. The following table shows typical values for a number of electrical devices commonly found in homes and workplaces. The measurements were taken in Germany and all of the appliances operate on electricity at a frequency of 50
Hz. It should be noted that the actual exposure levels vary considerably depending on the model of appliance and distance from it.Typical magnetic field strength of household appliances at various distancesElectric appliance3 cm distance (µT)

The table illustrates two main points: First, the magnetic field strength around all appliances rapidly decreases the further you get away from them. Secondly, most household appliances are not operated very close to the body. At a distance of 30
cm the magnetic fields surrounding most household appliances are more than 100 times lower than the given guideline limit of 100 µT at 50 Hz (83 µT at 60 Hz) for the general public.Television sets and computer screensComputer screens and television sets work on similar principles. Both produce static electric fields and alternating electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies. However, screens with liquid crystal displays used in some laptop computers and
desktop units do not give rise to significant electric and magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens which reduce the static field from the screen to a level similar to that of the normal background in the home or workplace. At
the position of operators (30 to 50 cm from the screen), alternating magnetic fields are typically below 0.7 µT in flux density (at power frequencies). Alternating electric field strengths at operator positions range from below 1 V/m up
to 10 V/m.Microwave ovensDomestic microwave ovens operate at very high power levels. However, effective shielding reduces leakage outside the ovens to almost non-detectable levels. Furthermore microwave leakage falls very rapidly with increasing distance from the oven. Many
countries have manufacturing standards that specify maximum leakage levels for new ovens; an oven that meets the manufacturing standards will not present any hazard to the consumer.Portable telephonesPortable telephones operate at much lower intensities than mobile phones. This is because they are employed very close to their home base station, and so do not need strong fields to transmit over long distances. As a consequence, the radiofrequency
fields that surround these devices are negligible.Electromagnetic fields in the environmentRadarRadars are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and military applications, as well as a variety of other functions. They emit pulsed microwave signals. The peak power in the pulse can be high even though the average power may
be low. Many radars rotate or move up and down; this reduces the mean power density to which the public is exposed in the vicinity of radars. Even high power, non-rotating military radars limit exposures to below guideline levels at locations
of public access.Security systemsAnti-theft systems in shops use tags that are detected by electrical coils at the exits. When a purchase is made the tags are removed or permanently deactivated. The electromagnetic fields from the coils do not generally exceed exposure guideline
levels. Access control systems work in the same way with the tag incorporated into a key ring or identity card. Library security systems use tags that can be deactivated when a book is borrowed and reactivated when it is returned. Metal detectors
and airport security systems set up a strong magnetic field of up to 100 µT that is disturbed by the presence of a metal object. Close to the frame of the detector, magnetic field strengths may approach and occasionally exceed guideline
levels. However, this does not constitute a health hazard, as will be discussed in the section on guidelines. (see Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?)Electric trains and tramsLong-distance trains have one or more engine cars that are separate from the passenger cars. Thus passenger exposure comes mainly from the electricity supply to the train. Magnetic fields in the passenger cars of long-distance trains can be several
hundred µT near the floor, with lower values (tens of µT) elsewhere in the compartment. Electric field strengths may reach 300 V/m. People living in the vicinity of railway lines may encounter magnetic fields from the overhead supply
which, depending on the country, may be comparable to the fields produced by high-voltage power lines.Motors and traction equipment of trains and trams are normally located underneath the floors of passenger cars. At floor level, magnetic field intensities may amount to tens of µT in regions of the floor just above the motor. The fields fall
off quickly with distance from the floor, and exposure of the upper bodies of passengers is much lower.TV and radioWhen choosing a radio station on your stereo at home, have you ever wondered what the familiar abbreviations AM and FM stand for? Radio signals are described as amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated (FM) depending on the way in which they
carry information. AM radio signals can be used for broadcasting over very long distances whereas FM waves cover more localized areas but can give a better sound quality.AM radio signals are transmitted via large arrays of antennas, which can be tens of metres high, on sites which are off-limits to the public. Exposures very close to antennas and feed cables can be high, but these would affect maintenance workers
rather than the general public.TV and FM radio antennas are much smaller than AM radio antennas and are mounted in arrays at the top of high towers. The towers themselves serve only as supporting structures. As exposures near the foot of these towers are below guideline limits,
public access to these areas may be possible. Small local TV and radio antennas are sometimes mounted on the top of buildings; if this is the case it may be necessary to control access to the roof.Mobile phones and their base stationsMobile phones allow people to be within reach at all times. These low-power radiowave devices transmit and receive signals from a network of fixed low power base stations. Each base station provides coverage to a given area. Depending on the number
of calls being handled, base stations may be from only a few hundred metres apart in major cities to several kilometres apart in rural areas.Mobile phone base stations are usually mounted on the tops of buildings or on towers at heights of between 15 and 50 metres. The levels of transmissions from any particular base station are variable and depend on the number of calls and the callers'
distance from the base station. Antennas emit a very narrow beam of radiowaves which spreads out almost parallel to the ground. Therefore, radiofrequency fields at ground level and in regions normally accessible to the public are many times below
hazard levels. Guidelines would only be exceeded if a person were to approach to within a metre or two directly in front of the antennas. Until mobile phones became widely used, members of the public were mainly exposed to radiofrequency emissions
from radio and TV stations. Even today, the phone towers themselves add little to our total exposure, as signal strengths in places of public access are normally similar to or lower than those from distant radio and TV stations.However, the user of a mobile phone is exposed to radiofrequency fields much higher than those found in the general environment. Mobile phones are operated very close to the head. Therefore, rather than looking at the heating effect across the whole
body, the distribution of absorbed energy in the head of the user must be determined. From sophisticated computer modeling and measurements using models of heads, it appears that the energy absorbed from a mobile phone is not in excess of current
guidelines.
Concerns about other so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically
excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health.Magnetic fields in everyday life: are they really that high?In recent years, national authorities in different countries have conducted many measurements to investigate electromagnetic field levels in the living environment. None of these surveys has concluded that field levels could bring about adverse health
effects.
The Federal Office for Radiation Safety in Germany recently measured the daily exposure to magnetic fields of about 2000 individuals across a range of occupations and public exposures. All of them were equipped with personal dosimeters for 24 hours.
The measured exposure varied widely but gave an average daily exposure of 0.10 µT. This value is a thousand times lower that the standard limit of 100 µT for the public and five thousand times lower than the 500 µT exposure limit
for workers. Furthermore, the exposure of people living in the centres of cities showed that there are no drastic differences in exposure between life in rural areas and life in the city. Even the exposure of people living in the vicinity of high
voltage power lines differs very little from the average exposure in the population.Key pointsBackground electromagnetic field levels in the home are mainly caused by the transmission and distribution facilities for electricity or by electrical appliances.Electrical appliances differ greatly in the strength of fields they generate. Both electric and magnetic field levels decrease rapidly with distance from the appliances. In any event, fields surrounding household appliances usually are far below
guideline limits.At operator positions the electric and magnetic fields of television sets and computer screens are hundreds of thousands times below guideline levels.Microwave ovens meeting the standards are not hazardous to health.As long as close public access to radar facilities, broadcasting antennas and mobile phone base stations is restricted, exposure guideline limits for radiofrequency fields will not be exceeded.The user of a mobile phone encounters field levels that are much higher than any levels in the normal living environment.

Similarly, field standards exist to limit overexposure to electromagnetic field levels present in our environment.Who decides on guidelines?Countries set their own national standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the majority of these national standards draw on the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This non-governmental organization, formally recognized by WHO, evaluates scientific results from all over the world. Based on an in-depth review of the literature, ICNIRP produces guidelines recommending limits on exposure. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and updated if necessary.Electromagnetic field levels vary with frequency in a complex way. Listing every value in every standard and at every frequency would be difficult to understand. The table below is a summary of the exposure guidelines for the three areas that have become the focus of public concern: electricity in the home, mobile phone base stations and microwave ovens. These guidelines were last updated in April 1998.Summary of the ICNIRP exposure guidelines European power frequencyMobile phone base station frequencyMicrowave oven frequencyFrequency50 Hz50 Hz900 MHz1.8 GHz2.45 GHz Electric field (V/m)Magnetic field (µT)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Public exposure limits5 0001004.5910Occupational exposure limits10 00050022.545 ICNIRP, EMF guidelines, Health Physics 74, 494-522 (1998)The exposure guidelines may differ by a factor of more than 100 between some former Soviet countries and Western countries. With the globalization of trade and the rapid introduction of telecommunications worldwide there is a need for universal standards. As many countries from the former Soviet Union are now considering new standards, the WHO has recently launched an initiative to harmonize exposure guidelines worldwide. Future standards will be based on the results of the WHO's International Electromagnetic Field Project.What are guidelines based on?An important point to make is that a guideline limit is not a precise delineation between safety and hazard. There is no one level above which exposures become hazardous to health; instead, the potential risk to human health gradually increases with higher exposure levels. Guidelines indicate that, below a given threshold, electromagnetic field exposure is safe according to scientific knowledge. However, it does not automatically follow that, above the given limit, exposure is harmful.Nevertheless, to be able to set limits on exposure, scientific studies need to identify the threshold level at which first health effects become apparent. As humans cannot be used for experiments, guidelines critically rely on animal studies. Subtle behavioural changes in animals at low levels often precede more drastic changes in health at higher levels. Abnormal behaviour is a very sensitive indicator of a biological response and has been selected as the lowest observable adverse health effect. Guidelines recommend the prevention of electromagnetic field exposure levels, at which behavioural changes become noticeable.This threshold level for behaviour is not equal to the guideline limit. ICNIRP applies a safety factor of 10 to derive occupational exposure limits, and a factor of 50 to obtain the guideline value for the general public. Therefore, for example, in the radiofrequency and microwave frequency ranges, the maximum levels you might experience in the environment or in your home are at least 50 times lower than the threshold level at which first behavioural changes in animals become apparent.Why is the safety factor for occupational exposure guidelines lower than for the general public?The occupationally exposed population consists of adults who generally experience known electromagnetic field conditions. These workers are trained to be aware of potential risk and to take appropriate precautions. By contrast, the general public consists of individuals of all ages and of varying health status. In many cases, these are unaware of their exposure to EMF. Moreover, individual members of the public cannot be expected to take precautions to minimize or avoid exposure. These are the underlying considerations for more stringent exposure restrictions for the general public than for the occupationally exposed population.As we have seen earlier, low frequency electromagnetic fields induce currents in the human body (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). But various biochemical reactions within the body itself generate currents as well. The cells or tissues will not be able to detect any induced currents below this background level. Therefore, at low frequencies, exposure guidelines ensure that the level of currents induced by an electromagnetic fields is below that of natural body currents.The main effect of radiofrequency energy is the heating of tissue. Consequently, exposure guidelines for radiofrequency fields and microwaves are set to prevent health effects caused by localized or whole-body heating (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). Compliance with the guidelines will ensure that heating effects are sufficiently small not to be harmful.What guidelines cannot account forAt present, speculations about potential long-term health effects cannot form the basis for the issuing of guidelines or standards. Adding up the results of all scientific studies, the overall weight of evidence does not indicate that electromagnetic fields cause long-term health effects such as cancer. National and international bodies set and update standards on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge to protect against known health effects.Guidelines are set for the average population and cannot directly address the requirements of a minority of potentially more sensitive people. Air pollution guidelines, for example, are not based on the special needs of asthmatics. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines are not designed to protect people from interference with implanted medical electronic devices such as heart pacemakers. Instead, advice about exposure situations to be avoided should be sought from the manufacturers and from the clinician implanting the device.What are typical maximum exposure levels at home and in the environment?Some practical information will help you to relate to the international guideline values given above. In the following table you will find the most common sources of electromagnetic fields. All values are maximum levels of public exposure – your own exposure is likely to be much lower. For a closer look at field levels around individual electrical appliances, please see the section Typical exposure levels at home and in the environment.SourceTypical maximum public exposureElectric field (V/m)Magnetic flux density (µT)Natural fields20070 (Earth's magnetic field)Mains power(in homes not close to power lines)1000.2Mains power(beneath large power lines)10 00020Electric trains and trams30050TV and computer screens(at operator position)100.7 Typical maximum public exposure (W/m2)TV and radio transmitters0.1Mobile phone base stations0.1Radars0.2Microwave ovens0.5Source: WHO Regional Office for EuropeHow are guidelines put into practice and who checks on them?The responsibility to investigate fields around power lines, mobile phone base stations or any other sources accessible to the general public lies with government agencies and local authorities. They must ensure that compliance with guidelines is maintained.With electronic devices, the manufacturer is responsible for complying with the standard limits. However, as we have seen above, the nature of most devices ensures that the emitted fields are well below the cut-off values. Furthermore, many consumer associations carry out tests on a regular basis. In case of any particular concern or worry, contact the manufacturer directly or enquire with your local public health authority.Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?It is perfectly safe to eat a pot of strawberry jam up to the expiration date – but if you consume the jam any later the manufacturer cannot guarantee good food quality. Nevertheless, even a few weeks or months after the expiration date, it will usually be safe to eat the jam. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines ensure that, within the given exposure limit, no known adverse health effects will occur. A large safety factor is applied to the level known to cause a health consequence. Therefore, even if you experienced field strengths several times higher than the given limit value, your exposure would still be within this safety margin.In everyday situations, most people do not experience electromagnetic fields that exceed the guideline limits. Typical exposures are far below these values. However, there are occasions where a person's exposure may, for a short period, approach or even exceed the guidelines. According to ICNIRP, radiofrequency and microwave exposures should be averaged over time to address cumulative effects. The guidelines specify a time-averaging period of six minutes and short-term exposures above the limits are acceptable.In contrast, exposure to low frequency electric and magnetic fields is not time-averaged in the guidelines. To make things even more complicated, another factor called coupling comes into play. Coupling refers to the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields and the exposed body. This depends on the size and shape of the body, the type of tissue and the orientation of the body relative to the field. Guidelines must be conservative: ICNIRP always assumes maximum coupling of the field to the exposed individual. Thus the guideline limits provide maximum protection. For example, even though the magnetic field values for hairdryers and electric shavers appear to exceed the recommended values, extremely weak coupling between the field and the head prevents the induction of electrical currents that could exceed guideline limits.Key pointsICNIRP issues guidelines on the basis of the current scientific knowledge. Most countries draw on these international guidelines for their own national standards.Standards for low frequency electromagnetic fields ensure that induced electric currents are below the normal level of background currents within the body. Standards for radiofrequency and microwaves prevent health effects caused by localized or whole body heating.Guidelines do not protect against potential interference with electromedical devices.Maximum exposure levels in everyday life are typically far below guideline limits.Due to a large safety factor, exposure above the guideline limits is not necessarily harmful to health. Furthermore time-averaging for high frequency fields and the assumption of maximum coupling for low frequency fields introduce an additional safety margin.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields
a7912127-4003-4434-bea3-6ec1cf66061e,What precautions are being followed?,"With more and more research data available, it has become increasingly unlikely that exposure to electromagnetic fields constitutes a serious health hazard, nevertheless, some uncertainty remains. The original scientific discussion about the interpretation of controversial results has shifted to become a societal as well as political issue.The public debate over electromagnetic fields focuses on the potential detriments of electromagnetic fields but often ignores the benefits associated with electromagnetic field technology. Without electricity, society would come to a standstill. Similarly, broadcasting and telecommunications have become a simple fact of modern life. An analysis of the balance between cost and potential hazards is essential.Protection of public healthInternational guidelines and national safety standards for electromagnetic fields are developed on the basis of the current scientific knowledge to ensure that the fields humans encounter are not harmful to health. To compensate uncertainties in knowledge (due, for example, to experimental errors, extrapolation from animals to humans, or statistical uncertainty), large safety factors are incorporated into the exposure limits. The guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated if necessary. It has been suggested that taking additional precautions to cope with remaining uncertainties may be a useful policy to adopt while science improves knowledge on health consequences. However, the type and extent of the cautionary policy chosen critically depends on the strength of evidence for a health risk and the scale and nature of the potential consequences. The cautionary response should be proportional to the potential risk. For more information, see the WHO Backgrounder on Cautionary Policies.Several policies promoting caution have been developed to address concerns about public, occupational and environmental health and safety issues connected with chemical and physical agents.What should be done while research continues?One of the objectives of the International EMF Project is to help national authorities weigh the benefits of using electromagnetic field technologies against the possibility that a health risk might be discovered. Furthermore, the WHO will issue recommendations on protective measures, if they may be needed. It will take some years for the required research to be completed, evaluated and published. In the meantime, the World Health Organization has issued a series of recommendations:Strict adherence to existing national or international safety standards: such standards, based on current knowledge, are developed to protect everyone in the population with a large safety factor.Simple protective measures: barriers around strong electromagnetic field sources help preclude unauthorized access to areas where exposure limits may be exceeded.Consultation with local authorities and the public in siting new power lines or mobile phone base stations: siting decisions are often required to take into account aesthetics and public sensitivities. Open communication during the planning stages can help create public understanding and greater acceptance of a new facility.Communication: an effective system of health information and communication among scientists, governments, industry and the public can help raise general awareness of programmes dealing with exposure to electromagnetic fields and reduce any mistrust and fears.For further information, see the WHO Fact Sheets on Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields

It could also be used to protect anyone else judged to have a high risk of exposure to smallpox. The vaccine cannot be used in people who are immune depressed or immune suppressed.After the eradication programme, a second generation of vaccines was developed that used the same smallpox vaccine strains as the vaccines used during the eradication campaign.

hazardous chemicals, such as pesticides, allow them to be classified as
carcinogenic (can cause cancer), neurotoxic (can cause damage to the
brain), or teratogenic (can cause damage to a fetus). This process of
classification, called “hazard identification,” is the first step of
“risk assessment”. An example of hazard identification is the
classification of substances according to their carcinogenicity to
humans carried out by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC), the specialized cancer agency of WHO.The same chemical can have different effects at different
doses, which depends on how much of the chemical a person is exposed to.

657533af-a76d-42cb-bbda-4395377c18c6,Why does WHO have 2 distinct processes for “hazard identification” and “risk assessment”?,"“Hazard identification”—in particular, the IARC classification
of substances in terms of their carcinogenicity—is the first step of
the “risk assessment” process. Classification of an agent as a
carcinogenic hazard is an important indication that some level of
exposure, for example from occupation, environment, food, etc., could
result in an increased risk of cancer.Risk assessment for pesticide residues in food, as conducted
by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), establishes a
safe intake level after assessing the level of risk. Acceptable daily
intakes (ADIs) are used by governments and international risk managers,
such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish maximum residue
limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. MRLs are enforced by national
authorities to ensure that the amount of pesticide residues consumers
are exposed to through eating food over a lifetime will not have adverse
health effects.IARC’s hazard identification can inform the JMPR’s risk
assessment, and thus the two processes can be complementary. For
example, IARC may identify new evidence from scientific studies on the
carcinogenicity of a chemical and, when necessary, JMPR conducts an
evaluation or a re-evaluation of the safety of that chemical as it is
used in agriculture and occurs in food.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-safety-pesticide-residue

The call for data for this JMPR meeting was published in October 2015. JMPR’s role is to evaluate (and re-evaluate) evidence, including new studies, classifications and findings, related to pesticides and their residues in food. This is a routine process in line with standard assessment of the level of risk associated with potential hazards.While glyphosate has gained high public interest, from a public health perspective the re-evaluation of malathion was also of importance, since it has use in vector control (against mosquitoes that can transmit diseases like dengue, Zika and malaria).

It does not estimate the level of ""risk"" to the population associated with exposure to the hazard. In contrast, JMPR reviews both published and unpublished studies to assess the level of health risk to consumers associated with dietary exposure to pesticide residues in food.In the case of diazinon, glyphosate and malathion, IARC’s Monograph Volume 112 classified the three compounds as ""probably carcinogenic"" from the perspective of hazard. The IARC Monographs did not estimate the cancer risks of these compounds from specific exposure routes or levels of exposure.JMPR’s risk assessment found out that based on the weight-of-evidence approach these compounds are unlikely to cause cancer in people via dietary exposure. This means it is possible to establish safe exposure levels – acceptable daily intakes (ADI) – for consumers.

peripheral nervous system. In other words, the brain, spinal cord,
cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, nerve roots, autonomic nervous
system, neuromuscular junction, and muscles. These disorders include
epilepsy, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, cerebrovascular
diseases including stroke, migraine and other headache disorders,
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, neuroinfections, brain tumours,
traumatic disorders of the nervous system due to head trauma, and
neurological disorders as a result of malnutrition.
Many bacterial (i.e. Mycobacterial tuberculosis, Neisseria
meningitides), viral (i.e. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
Enteroviruses, West Nile Virus, Zika), fungal (i.e. Cryptococcus,
Aspergillus), and parasitic (i.e. malaria, Chagas) infections can affect
the nervous system. Neurological symptoms may occur due to the
infection itself, or due to an immune response.Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are affected by
neurological disorders. More than 6 million people die because of stroke
each year; over 80% of these deaths take place in low- and
middle-income countries. More than 50 million people have epilepsy
worldwide. It is estimated that there are globally 47.5 million people
with dementia with 7.7 million new cases every year - Alzheimer's
disease is the most common cause of dementia and may contribute to

As a consequence of the tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS), located along the shoreline, lost its core cooling capacity which caused severe damage to the reactor’s core and led to a nuclear accident rated as Level 7 on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES). Substantial amounts of radioactive materials (radionuclides) were released into the environment following explosions at the FDNPS on March 12, 14 and 15.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident

The main radionuclides to which individuals were exposed included iodine-131 (131I) and caesium-137 (137Cs). 131I has a radioactive half-life of eight days and can be inhaled with the air and ingested with contaminated food or water, mainly by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. In the human body, iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland. Exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their metabolism. 137Cs has a half-life of 30 years and this implies long term risk of exposure through ingestion and through exposure from ground deposition.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident

The assessment of the doses included both external and internal (through inhalation of the radioactive
plume and ingestion of radioactivity in food) exposure pathways. A large survey of the health of residents of Fukushima Prefecture, the Fukushima Health Management Survey,
has estimated individual doses based on typical scenarios of evacuation and time spent indoors and outdoors. Based on this survey and the dose
assessments done by WHO and by UNSCEAR, the average lifetime effective doses for adults in the Fukushima prefecture were estimated to be around 10 mSv or less, and about twice for 1-year old infants.
See:Preliminary dose estimation from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and TsunamiSources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation, UNSCEAR 2013 Report, vol. 1The doses incurred by workers were reported by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and by some of its contractors. According to TEPCO records, the average workers’ effective dose over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 mSv. About 35% of the workforce received total doses of more than 10 mSv over that period, while 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv.

These measures were taken based on radiation safety considerations and the massive damage to the infrastructure and facilities following the earthquake and tsunami. These measures resulted in a wide range of social, economic, and public health consequences. A sharp increase in mortality among elderly people who were put in temporary housings has been reported, along with increased risk of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and mental health problems. The lack of access to health care further contributed to deterioration of health.Similar to what was observed and reported for the Chernobyl population, the displaced Fukushima population is suffering from psycho-social and mental health impact following relocation, ruptured social links of people who lost homes and employment, disconnected family ties and stigmatization. A higher occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the evacuees was assessed as compared to the general population of Japan. Psychological problems, such as hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, and conduct disorders have been also reported among evacuated Fukushima children6. While no significant adverse outcomes were observed in the pregnancy and birth survey after the disaster, a higher prevalence of postpartum depression was noted among mothers in the affected region.See:Psychological distress and the perception of radiation risks: the Fukushima health management survey  - WHO bulletin 2015",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident

It included an evaluation of the risks of cancers, non-cancer diseases as well as public health considerations. The following year, UNSCEAR published a report on the levels and effects
of radiation exposure due to the accident. In 2015, UNSCEAR released a white paper that evaluates new information in the peer-reviewed literature.See:Health risk assessment from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, based on a preliminary dose estimationSources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation, UNSCEAR 2013 Report, Vol. IDevelopments since the 2013 UNSCEAR Report on the levels and effects of radiation exposure due to the nuclear accident following the great east-Japan earthquake and tsunami - UNSCEAR Fukushima 2015 White PaperThere were no acute radiation injuries or deaths among the workers or the public due to exposure to radiation resulting from the FDNPS accident.Considering the level of estimated doses, the lifetime radiation-induced cancer risks other than thyroid are small and much smaller than the lifetime baseline cancer risks. Regarding the risk of thyroid cancer in exposed infants and children,
the level of risk is uncertain since it is difficult to verify thyroid dose estimates by direct measurements of radiation exposure.For the twelve workers who were estimated to have received the highest absorbed radiation doses to the thyroid, an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer and other thyroid disorders was estimated. About 160 additional workers who received whole body effective doses estimated to be over 100 mSv, an increased risk of cancer could be expected in the future although it will not be detectable by epidemiological studies because of the difficulty of confirming a small incidence against the normal statistical fluctuations in cancer incidence.From a global health perspective, the health risks directly related to radiation exposure are low in Japan and extremely low in neighbouring countries and the rest of the world.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident
be6fe1cb-65e0-41ab-91e7-2bf908ae60be,Is there a risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer among children of Fukushima prefecture?,"Given the exposure to radioactive iodine during the early phase of the emergency, WHO specifically assessed the risk of thyroid cancer. The greatest risk was found among girls exposed as infants (i.e. < 1 year old) in the most affected area in the Fukushima prefecture. Even if those levels of risk might not be clinically detectable, WHO anticipated that the thyroid ultrasound screening programme being conducted in Fukushima prefecture was likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid diseases due to earlier detection of non-symptomatic cases.There have been recent reports about thyroid cancer cases being diagnosed among children exposed to low doses of radioactive iodine as a result of the Fukushima accident. These reports should be interpreted with caution. A large excess of thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure, such as occurred after the Chernobyl accident, can be discounted because the estimated thyroid doses due to the Fukushima accident were substantially lower than in Chernobyl. Nevertheless, the highly-sensitive thyroid screening of those under 18 years old at the time of the accident is expected to detect a large number of thyroid cysts and solid nodules, including a number of thyroid cancers that would not have been detected without such intensive screening. Similar or even slightly higher rates of cysts and nodules were found in prefectures not affected by the nuclear accident. The substantial number of cases that have already been observed in the Fukushima Health Management Survey have been considered likely due to the sensitivity of the screening rather than to radiation exposure. Further analysis of epidemiological data being currently collected in Japan will be necessary to evaluate a potential attribution of thyroid cancer to radiation exposure.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident

Since the early phase of the emergency, the Japanese authorities have monitored food contamination closely and implemented protective measures to prevent sale and distribution of contaminated food in Japan
and outside of Japan.WHO works closely with FAO through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to ensure that

A number of lessons were learned that help Japan and all countries better plan, prepare, respond and recovery from potential nuclear accidents. These include:Evacuation aims to minimize or prevent health risks of radiation exposure. However the process of evacuation itself, especially under the conditions of a severe natural disaster, may pose serious health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations (such as those with disabilities, older populations, young children).Relocating thousands of people has caused a wide range of health consequences including increase of disaster-related deaths, psychosocial and access to health care issues. Disrupted infrastructure, disconnection of evacuees from their municipalities, reduced number of health workers and failure of local public health and medical systems due to relocation made it more difficult to address these issues.Strengthening of public health services and improving access to health care are key issues for the well-being of evacuees, in addition to mental health and psychological support, behavioral and societal support.Risk communication proved to be essential and should be carried out by trained specialists.

Population health surveillance will permit the identification of additional needs for the delivery of health care. Moreover, as part of the occupational health programmes, a special protocol for medical follow-up of emergency workers is being implemented.To date, the biggest challenge for the mitigation of the public health consequences of the triple disaster is the restoration of the social fabric and social trust. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction post-2015 underlines that response to major disasters should include social mobilization and empowerment of local communities. Community representatives should be involved in the decision-making on protective and restoration actions that would consider the needs and priorities of local communities.Steps towards improving the psycho-social and socio-economic consequences of the disaster should be considered. Health systems need to provide effective counselling services and social support in a team approach and people-centered care.

number of people are exposed to artificial sources used in industry,
commerce and recreation. The sun is by far the strongest source of ultraviolet radiation in our environment. Solar emissions include visible light, heat and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Just as visible light consists of different colours that become apparent in a rainbow, the UV radiation spectrum is divided into three regions called UVA, UVB and UVC. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, all UVC and most UVB is absorbed by ozone, water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide. UVA is not filtered as significantly by the atmosphere.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)
440bc10d-dfdb-4720-8b32-9db6ec6afc0b,Is there a connection between ozone depletion and UV radiation?,"Ozone is a particularly effective absorber of UV radiation. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere is progressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB.Ozone depletion is caused by human-made chemicals released into the atmosphere and will continue until the use of chlorine and bromine compounds is drastically reduced. International agreements, in particular the Montreal Protocol, are gradually succeeding in phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances. However, the long life span of the chemicals already released will cause ozone depletion problems to persist for many years to come. A full recovery of the ozone level is not expected until 2050.The incidence of different types of skin cancer has been growing dramatically over the past decades. Some people claim that this is due to ozone depletion and enhanced levels of UV. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increased cancer rates is altered behaviour rather than ozone depletion. More outdoor activities and altered sunbathing habits often result in excessive UV exposure. Raised awareness and changes in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)
87367eab-9a73-4b05-8297-691c8319935d,"What is the difference between UVA, UVB and UVC?","The three types of UV radiation are classified according to their wavelength. They differ in their biological activity and the extent to which they can penetrate the skin. The shorter the wavelength, the more harmful the UV radiation. However, shorter wavelength UV radiation is less able to penetrate the skin.The UV region covers the wavelength range 100-400 nm and is divided into three bands:UVA (315-400 nm)UVB (280-315 nm)UVC (100-280 nm).Short-wavelength UVC is the most damaging type of UV radiation. However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface.Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere.The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)
974c2047-e3aa-46b9-a905-89e4f69356d0,Which environmental factors affect a person's UV exposure?,"Time of year and time of dayUV levels vary mainly with the height of the sun in the sky and in mid-latitudes are highest during the summer months during the 4-hour period around solar noon. During these times the sun's rays take the most direct path to earth. In contrast, during early morning or late afternoon hours the sun's rays pass at a greater angle through the atmosphere. Much more UV radiation is absorbed and less reaches the Earth.LatitudeUV levels are higher closer to the equator. Closer to the equator the sun's rays have a shorter distance to travel through the atmosphere and therefore less of the harmful UV radiation can be absorbed.AltitudeWith increasing altitude less atmosphere is available to absorb UV radiation. With every 1000 m in altitude, UV levels increase by approximately 10 per cent.Clouds and hazeBe careful not to underestimate the amount of UV radiation passing through clouds.Many surfaces reflect UV radiation and add to the overall UV levels you experience. While grass, soil or water reflect less than 10 per cent of incident UV radiation, sand reflects about 15 per cent, and sea foam about 25 per cent. Fresh snow is a particularly good reflector and almost doubles a person's UV exposure. Recurring incidences of snow blindness or photokeratitis in skiers emphasize that UV protective measures must take ground reflection into account.UV levels are highest under cloudless skies, and cloud cover generally reduces a person's exposure. However, light or thin clouds have little effect and may even enhance UV levels because of scattering. Don't be fooled by an overcast day or a cool breeze! Even a long stay in open shade, for example between buildings, may give a sensitive person a sunburn on a day with high UV levels.OzoneOzone absorbs some of the UV radiation that would otherwise
reach the Earth’s surface. Ozone levels vary over the year and even
across the day.Ground reflectionUV radiation is reflected or scattered to
varying extents by different surfaces, e.g. snow can reflect as much as
80% of UV radiation, dry beach sand about 15%, and sea foam about 25%.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)

the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika
virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus
infection within 14 days after blood donation.Blood components of appropriate shelf life (e.g. red blood cells)
may be quarantined for a period of 7–14 days and released following
confirmation from the donor that he or she has not experienced symptoms

Ebola care during this multi-country outbreak has necessitated unique medical knowledge and equipment, and has carried unique risks for health care workers. The progress made against Ebola is part thanks to the response by the national and international teams that run the 72 Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) across three countries.WHO and the world have learned important lessons from the Ebola response that have a wider application to the agency and the global health response community. These lessons have been used to improve coordination, quality and predictability of clinical response teams deploying with surge capacity as EMTs.Over 40 organizations, including international NGOs, military, faith-based organizations and governments have deployed EMTs throughout the current Ebola Response.Countries that have sent EMTs to West Africa include Australia, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Germany,Kenya, Korea, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, United Kingdom and United States of America.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams

553db23a-aa90-4006-b4a5-8350ef60f14c,What is GMP?,"Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. The main risks are: unexpected contamination of products, causing damage to health or even death; incorrect labels on containers, which could mean that patients receive the wrong medicine; insufficient or too much active ingredient, resulting in ineffective treatment or adverse effects. GMP covers all aspects of production; from the starting materials, premises and equipment to the training and personal hygiene of staff. Detailed, written procedures are essential for each process that could affect the quality of the finished product. There must be systems to provide documented proof that correct procedures are consistently followed at each step in the manufacturing process - every time a product is made. WHO has established detailed guidelines for good manufacturing practice. Many countries have formulated their own requirements for GMP based on WHO GMP. Others have harmonized their requirements, for example in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), in the European Union and through the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes

The short life span of SLCPs means that assertive action now to reduce emissions can rapidly improve both air quality as well as slowing the rate of near-term climate change.The main SLCPs of direct concern to health include black carbon (or ‘soot’), methane and ozone, which all contribute to both health-harmful air pollution and global warming. . Black carbon (BC) makes up a significant portion of fine particulate matter, the air pollutant most associated with premature death and morbidity. Ozone has significant adverse impacts on respiratory health, and methane contributes to ozone formation. Mitigation experts believe that firm actions reducing SLCP emissions could slow the pace of climate change by as much as .5⁰ C over the next few decades. Even so, it is important to note that SLCP reduction measures complement, but do not replace, the actions needed to reduce longer-lived CO2 emissions for climate stabilization.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants
60ab29c0-6008-42b0-a6c3-f102bd32885e,Where do these pollutants come from?,"Open fires, (including wildfires, deliberate forest/brush burning, and burning of urban and crop waste), comprise the largest single source of black carbon emissions. Fuel combustion in residential and commercial buildings, as well as transport, account for approximately 80% of black carbon emissions from human activities related to energy production and use. Emissions from diesel, biomass and kerosene combustion are among the sources with the heaviest black carbon concentrations, and accordingly have been identified as priority sources for reducing emissions that contribute to near-term climate change.Particulate emissions from other sources, such as coal-fired power plants, are also a source of black carbon emissions, but here BC is co-emitted with other pollutants that have a climate “cooling” effect so that mitigation in this sector would have less of an impact on near-term climate change. In health terms, however, mitigation efforts that reduce fine particulates from other sources can, of course, be beneficial, and may also may reduce CO2 and thus longer term climate change.Ozone is not emitted directly but develops when a number of “precursor” pollution emissions interact in the presence of sunlight. Precursor emissions often include; methane, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide. Ozone is the second SLCP that causes adverse respiratory effects, with impacts ranging from changes in lung function and increased incidence of asthma to premature mortality. Methane is a powerful SLCP in and of itself, mainly produced from the agriculture sector, including livestock production, waste sector, and as a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction and distribution.

SLCP emissions thus contribute significantly to the more than 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution.Indirectly, the SLCPs ozone and black carbon reduce plant photosynthesis and growth, thus decreasing agricultural yields, which in turn threatens food security.

In fact, addressing SLCPs has distinct advantages insofar as health benefits from many measures can be enjoyed in the near term, and along with slowing the rate of near-term climate change, measures can be very complementary with longer-term CO2 emissions reductions required to reduce long-term climate change.

The CO2 reduction potential of the same strategies was also considered, since SLCP mitigation is seen as complementary to mitigation of CO2 emissions required to stabilize climate and ensure the health of future generations. Four strategies were identified which appear to have the largest aggregate potential for health and SLCP mitigation benefits as well as reducing CO2.Policies and investments that prioritize dedicated rapid transit and walking and cycling networks in compact cities can promote health in multiple ways, including reduced air pollution exposures, reduced injury risks and greater opportunities for safe active travel.Encouraging healthier diets rich in plant-based foods and low in red and processed meats among affluent populations at risk of a range of diet-related noncommunicable diseases will have a positive effect on health and will also reduce emissions.Provide and promote the use of clean and efficient cook-stoves and fuels, and cleaner energy sources, to the approximately 2.8 billion low-income households that currently rely on solid fuels for heating and cooking.Reducing vehicle emissions of both particulate matter as well as ozone precursors (e.g. NO2) by implementing stricter vehicle and fuel emissions and efficiency standards.Along with these four, however, many other SLCP measures identified in this report are also very beneficial to health. Examples include improved waste management strategies, more energy efficient homes and buildings, phasing out kerosene lamps and greater reliance on clean light and power sources, using including renewable energy, for homes and health clinics, cleaner brick industries and coke ovens, etc. Measures outlined can reduce many other types of health risks, ranging from: housing related diseases associated with exposure to extreme heat, cold or damp; sanitation-related diseases; air pollution from kerosene and generator fumes; work-related diseases, and so on..

5846aa60-43eb-40c5-98b9-a3540b7b21db,In what ways will reducing emissions be beneficial for health?,"In summary, there are three key ways in which reducing emissions of SLCPs can provide health benefits:directly, it will reduce air pollution exposures and related diseases;indirectly, the negative effects that ozone and black carbon have on weather and food production, which affect food security, will be reduced;As a result of certain SLCP mitigation actions, such as improved transport systems, healthier diets, or better waste management, there other health benefits may also be obtained, such as improved chances for physical activity, less risk of traffic injury, reduced risks of diet-related chronic diseases, or reduced exposure to waste and sanitation-related health risks.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants
62c073b3-3251-4270-810a-bd762e9b74ff,Why should we act now?,"There is increasing evidence that direct exposure to certain SLCPs is associated with ill-health. As their name indicates, SLCPs have a short life-span in the atmosphere, which means that once emissions are reduced they disappear relatively quickly and health benefits begin to occur soon after and in some cases almost immediately. Another important feature is that benefits will occur near where mitigation takes place, directly benefitting the health of communities. Therefore, controlling emissions of these SLCPs or their precursors could save lives through improved air quality, reduce expected warming by .5⁰C or more over the next few decades and contribute to food security.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants
6fec8205-d1c8-4162-946b-084b5313bcf6,Why is it important for policymakers?,"Health benefits from SLCP mitigation measures in the communities where actions are taken and in the near-term, making them particularly attractive from a policy standpoint.Mitigation measures are highly compatible with the immediate development priorities of local and national policymakers since they reduce harmful air pollution, make cities healthier and more attractive to live and work, and also provide greater opportunities for healthier lifestyles.The short lifespan of SLCPs means that once emissions are reduced, benefits begin to occur very soon after actions are taken.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants
70ed3f7d-b024-43d6-8926-23c044e42853,What can I do?,"Some simple lifestyle choices coming from individuals can have potential benefits for reducing emissions and contributing to better health. Although policy decisions make up a big part for mitigation actions, the choices we make on what we eat, how we travel, and the energy sources we use, for example, choosing to take public transport over private cars and being active by walking or cycling will contribute to the reduction of emissions and noise pollution while increasing health and well-being.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants
9591953d-174e-422f-ab51-5362749ed664,What else is being addressed?,"There are other benefits of reducing SLCP emissions. Aside from the large benefits for public health, many of the health-enhancing strategies for reducing SLCP emissions can also lead to substantial co-reductions in CO2 emissions and therefore, help mitigate both near- and long-term climate change.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants

67670cad-d83d-45a4-8521-0fe9fb2cd43d,"How does PPM enhance the quality of diagnosis, treatment, decentralize and make treatment conveniently accessible for patients?",PPM reduces malpractice by fostering evidence-based TB diagnosis and treatment in line with the International Standards for TB Care. This improves cure rates and reduces risks of drug resistance development. It also limits misdiagnosis of TB and unnecessary and often costly treatments.,https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/public-private-mix-ppm-for-tb-care-and-control
59fc79c1-f0aa-4168-bedc-47583bbc08d9,How does PPM increase case detection and reduce diagnostic delays?,"PPM helps increase TB case detection and reduces diagnostic delays by involving all health care providers in timely referral ,diagnosis , ensures proper notification of all diagnosed cases and enrollment on appropriate treatment under programme guidelines. The engagement of private providers entails adequate training of these providers to ensure that the quality of their services is aligned with the International Standards for TB care. In addition evidence shows that private providers are often the first point of contact for health services. These providers (with adequate training) could play an important role in case detection and referral of patients to the public sector cutting down significantly on diagnostic delays.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/public-private-mix-ppm-for-tb-care-and-control
aac2431c-114a-43d4-9cdf-08456fe95c17,Does PPM afford improved and equitable access to TB care to all patients?,"PPM improves access to treatment by involving health care providers from whom the poor, marginalized and most vulnerable seek care. Often public health facilities are situated at a distance from the home or workplace of the patient, therefore access to these services involves transportation costs and loss of wages which are barriers in access to health care for disadvantaged populations. The involvement of all providers in PPM enhances access of closer-to-home health services for both men and women.In addition PPM ensures that proper notification and enrollment for appropriate treatment under programme guidelines of all diagnosed patients is carried out.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/public-private-mix-ppm-for-tb-care-and-control

601d015e-dc15-45af-8ac9-739b5f414c79,Does PPM ensure better access to health care services for women as compared to other health services?,"Women in many developing countries often have less power to make decisions on healthcare utilization. Additionally, public health facilities are not always easily accessible from their places of residence. The cost of transportation and the loss of income for both the patient and the guardian or escort are major inhibitors for women in access to public health care. Therefore in many cases they first approach the private sector for health services.

89a476e1-e75c-4e7f-ae20-88c81c867872,What is raised blood pressure (hypertension)?,"Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a
condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure,
putting them under increased stress. Each time the heart beats; it
pumps blood into the vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body.
Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the
walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The
higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump.
Normal adult blood pressure is defined as a blood pressure of 120 mm Hg1
when the heart beats (systolic) and a blood pressure of 80 mm Hg when
the heart relaxes (diastolic). When systolic blood pressure is equal to
or above 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure equal to or above
90 mm Hg the blood pressure is considered to be raised or high.Most people with hypertension have no symptoms at all; this is
why it is known as the “silent killer”. Sometimes hypertension causes
symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain,
palpitations of the heart and nose bleeds, but not always.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension
cd324918-f65f-4030-93d4-b8d3fdcfad5b,Why is raised blood pressure dangerous?,"The higher the blood pressure, the higher the risk of damage to
the heart and blood vessels in major organs such as the brain and
kidneys. Hypertension is the most important preventable cause of heart
disease and stroke worldwide.
If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack,
an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels
may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots that make them more
likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can cause
blood to leak out into the brain and cause a stroke. Hypertension can
also lead to kidney failure, blindness, and cognitive impairment. The health consequences of hypertension can be compounded by
other factors that increase the odds of heart attack, stroke and kidney
failure. These factors include tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use
of alcohol, lack of physical activity, and exposure to persistent stress
as well as obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes mellitus.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension
07d468ae-4730-4711-a93a-b903bd0f81fe,How can raised blood pressure be prevented and treated?,"All adults should have their blood pressure checked. routinely,
it is important to know your numbers. If blood pressure is high, they
need the advice of a health worker.
For some people, lifestyle changes such as stopping tobacco
use, eating healthily, exercising regularly and avoiding the harmful use
of alcohol, are sufficient to control blood pressure. Reduction in salt
intake can also help. For others, these changes are insufficient and
they need prescription medication to control blood pressure.Adults can support treatment by adhering to the prescribed medication, lifestyle changes and by monitoring their health.People with high blood pressure that also have high blood
sugar, elevated blood cholesterol or kidney damage face even higher risk
of heart attacks and stroke. Therefore it is important that regular
checks for blood sugar, blood cholesterol and urine albumin take place.Everyone can take five concrete steps to minimize the odds of developing high blood pressure and its adverse consequences. Healthy diet:promoting a healthy lifestyle with emphasis on proper nutrition for infants and young people;reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day (just under a teaspoon);eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day;reducing saturated and total fat intake.Avoiding harmful use of alcohol i.e. limit intake to no more than one standard drink a dayPhysical activity:regular physical activity and promotion of physical activity for children and young people (at least 30 minutes a day). maintaining a normal weight: every 5 kg of excess weight lost can reduce systolic blood pressure by 2 to 10 points.Stopping tobacco use and exposure to tobacco productsManaging stress in healthy way such as through meditation, appropriate physical exercise, and positive social contact.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension
0741e349-b94d-4c7d-992a-7ee31357a607,How common is raised blood pressure?,"More than 1 in 5 adults worldwide have raised blood pressure – a
condition that causes around half of all deaths from stroke and heart
disease. Complications from hypertension account for 9.4 million deaths
worldwide every year.
In nearly all high-income countries, widespread diagnosis and
treatment with low-cost medication have led to a significant drop in the
proportion of people with raised blood pressure, as well as the average
blood pressure across populations – and this has contributed to a
reduction in deaths from heart disease. For example, the prevalence of
raised blood pressure in the WHO region of the Americas in 2014 was 18%,
as compared to 31% in 1980.In contrast, low-income countries have the highest prevalence
of raised blood pressure. In the WHO African region, more than 30% of
adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure and
this proportion is increasing. Furthermore, the average blood pressure
levels in this region are much higher than global averages.Many people with high blood pressure in developing countries
are not aware of their disease, and do not have access to treatments
that could control their blood pressure and significantly reduce their
risk of death and disability from heart disease and stroke. Detection,
treatment and control of hypertension is an important health priority
worldwide.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/noncommunicable-diseases-hypertension
7bd304fe-b1d0-441c-ad3d-1341fcdcf5d6,What are the common health problems of refugees and migrants arriving in the European Region?,"The health problems of refugees and migrants are similar to
those of the rest of the population, although some groups may have a
higher prevalence. The most frequent health problems of newly arrived
migrants include accidental injuries, hypothermia, burns, cardiovascular
events, pregnancy and delivery-related complications, diabetes and
hypertension. Female migrants frequently face specific challenges,
particularly in maternal, newborn and child health, sexual and
reproductive health, and violence.
The exposure of migrants to the risks associated with
population movements – psychosocial disorders, reproductive health
problems, higher newborn mortality, drug abuse, nutrition disorders,
alcoholism and exposure to violence – increase their vulnerability to
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The key issue with regard to NCDs is
the interruption of care, due either to lack of access or to the
decimation of health care systems and providers; displacement results in
interruption of the continuous treatment that is crucial for chronic
conditions. Vulnerable children are prone to acute infections such as
respiratory infections and diarrhoea because of poor living conditions
and deprivation during migration, and they require access to acute care.
Lack of hygiene can lead to skin infections. Furthermore, the number of
casualties and deaths among refugees and migrants crossing the
Mediterranean Sea has increased rapidly, with a reported 1867 people
drowned or missing at sea in the first 6 months of 2015, according to
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region
6bbc8f12-bf12-4599-8ee6-2a8333322ef7,What are the WHO recommendations for triage and screening of migrants upon arrival?,"WHO does not recommend obligatory screening of refugee and
migrant populations for diseases, because there is no clear evidence of
benefits (or cost-effectiveness); furthermore, it can trigger anxiety in
individual refugees and the wider community.
WHO strongly recommends offering and providing health checks
to ensure access to health care for all refugees and migrants in need of
health protection. Health checks should be done for both communicable
and NCDs, with respect for migrants' human rights and dignity.The results of screening must never be used as a reason or justification for ejecting a refugee or a migrant from a country.Obligatory screening deters migrants from asking for a medical check-up and jeopardizes identification of high-risk patients.In spite of the common perception that there is an association
between migration and the importation of infectious diseases, there is
no systematic association. Refugees and migrants are exposed mainly to
the infectious diseases that are common in Europe, independently of
migration. The risk that exotic infectious agents, such as Ebola virus,
will be imported into Europe is extremely low, and when it occurs,
experience shows that it affects regular travellers, tourists or health
care workers rather than refugees or migrants.Triage is recommended at points of entry to identify health
problems in refugees and migrants soon after their arrival. Proper
diagnosis and treatment must follow, and the necessary health care must
be ensured for specific population groups (children, pregnant women,
elderly). Each and every person on the move must have full access to a
hospitable environment, to prevention (e.g. vaccination) and, when
needed, to high-quality health care, without discrimination on the basis
of gender, age, religion, nationality or race. This is the safest way
to ensure that the resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to
imported infectious agents. WHO supports policies to provide health care
services to migrants and refugees irrespective of their legal status as
part of universal health coverage.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region
9bc333d1-aae0-4846-8963-2ed1e443c278,What does WHO recommend with regard to vaccination for newly arrived migrants?,"Transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to host country
populations is just as likely to happen after the return of a resident
of that country from a holiday in an endemic country as after the
arrival of a migrant from the country. There are still large gaps in the
immunity of populations across the Region, either because countries
decide not to avail themselves of the benefits of vaccination or because
of limited access to vaccination services.
The WHO Regional Office for Europe does not routinely collect
information on transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases among
migrants or on their immunization coverage. However, well-documented
outbreaks of measles have originated by transmission from migrants,
mobile populations, international travellers and tourists alike. Equitable access to vaccination is of prime importance and is
one of the objectives of the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020. The
plan proposes that all countries in the Region pay special attention to
ensuring the eligibility and access of migrants, international
travellers and marginalized communities to (culturally) appropriate
vaccination services and information. We applaud the many countries,
such as those receiving large influxes of migrants, that are including
migrants into their routine vaccination programmes. More on immunization coverage of all countries",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region
c04cb11f-82c3-4137-b43a-b4676d0f2d1f,What health care access does WHO recommend for refugees and migrants?,"Legal status is one of the most important determinants of the
access of migrants to health services in a country. Each and every
refugee and migrant must have full, uninterrupted access to a hospitable
environment and, when needed, to high-quality health care, without
discrimination on the basis of gender, age, religion, nationality or
race. WHO supports policies to provide health care services irrespective
of migrants' legal status. As rapid access to health care can result in
cure, it can avoid the spread of diseases; it is therefore in the
interest of both migrants and the receiving country, to ensure that the
resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to the importation of

develop migrant-sensitive health policies; strengthen health systems to provide equitable access to services;establish information systems to assess migrant health; share information on best practices; increase the cultural and gender sensitivity and specific training of health service providers and professionals; and promote multilateral cooperation among countries in
accordance with resolution WHA61.17 on the health of migrants endorsed
by the Sixty-first World Health Assembly in 2008.WHO has been working on the health issues related to people's
movements for many years. The WHO European health policy framework
Health 2020 has drawn particular attention to migration and health, with
population vulnerability and human rights. Following the political,
economic and humanitarian crises in the north of Africa and the Middle
East, WHO, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Health,
established the Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project in
April 2012. The aims are: to strengthen health system capacity to meet the health needs of mixed inflows of migrants and host populations; promote immediate health interventions; ensure migrant-sensitive health policies; improve the quality of the health services delivered; and optimize use of health structures and resources in countries receiving migrant populations. Up to August 2015, the Regional Office had conducted joint
assessment missions with ministries of health in Bulgaria, Cyprus,
Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Serbia and Spain, with the new ""Toolkit
for assessing health system capacity to manage large influxes of
migrants in the acute phase,"" to respond to and address the complex,

77da5867-8aa3-4073-b035-00588489b509,What can I do to avoid a heart attack or a stroke?,"WHO estimates that more than 17.5 million people died of
cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke in 2012. Contrary
to popular belief, more than 3 out of 4 of these deaths occurred in
low- and middle-income countries, and men and women were equally
affected.
The good news, however, is that 80% of premature heart attacks
and strokes are preventable. Healthy diet, regular physical activity,
and not using tobacco products are the keys to prevention. Checking and
controlling risk factors for heart disease and stroke such as high blood
pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar or diabetes is also
very important.Eat a healthy diet: A balanced diet is crucial to a
healthy heart and circulation system. This should include plenty of
fruit and vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish and pulses with
restricted salt, sugar and fat intake. Alcohol should also be used in
moderation.Take regular physical activity: At least 30 minutes of
regular physical activity every day helps to maintain cardiovascular
fitness; at least 60 minutes on most days of the week helps to maintain
healthy weight.Avoid tobacco use: Tobacco in every form is very
harmful to health - cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or chewable tobacco.
Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is also dangerous. The risk of
heart attack and stroke starts to drop immediately after a person stops
using tobacco products, and can drop by as much as half after 1 year.Check and control your overall cardiovascular risk: An
important aspect of preventing heart attacks and strokes is by providing
treatment and counselling to individuals at high risk (those with a 10
year cardiovascular risk equal to or above 30%) and reducing their
cardiovascular risk. A health worker can estimate your cardiovascular
risk using simple risk charts and provide the appropriate advice for
managing your risk factors.Know your blood pressure: High blood pressure usually has
no symptoms, but is one of the biggest causes of sudden stroke or heart
attack. Have your blood pressure checked and know your numbers. If it is
high, you will need to change your lifestyle to incorporate a healthy
diet with less salt intake and increase physical activity, and may need
medications to control your blood pressure.Know your blood lipids: Raised blood cholesterol and
abnormal blood lipids increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Blood cholesterol needs to be controlled through a healthy diet and, if
necessary, by appropriate medications.Know your blood sugar: Raised blood glucose (diabetes)
increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. If you have diabetes it
is very important to control your blood pressure and blood sugar to
minimize the risk.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cardiovascular-diseases-avoiding-heart-attacks-and-strokes
d1b68094-9e69-4f42-b3fb-7f72e322e165,Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?,"Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. ""Exclusive breastfeeding"" is defined as giving no other food or drink – not
even water – except breast milk. It does, however, allow the infant to receive oral rehydration salts (ORS), drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines). Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants;
breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional
needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to minimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires active care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.The transition from exclusive breastfeeding to full use of family foods is a very vulnerable period. It is the time when many infants become malnourished, contributing significantly to the high prevalence of malnutrition in children under five years of
age worldwide. It is essential therefore that infants receive appropriate, adequate and safe complementary foods to ensure the right transition from the breastfeeding period to the full use of family foods.Amounts of foods to offerAgeTextureFrequencyAmount at each meala6–8 monthsStart with thick porridge, well mashed foodsContinue with mashed family foods2–3 meals per day, plus frequent breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offeredStart with 2–3 tablespoonfuls per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup9–11 monthsFinely chopped or mashed foods, and foods that baby can pick up3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered½ of a 250 ml cup/bowl12–23 monthsFamily foods, chopped or mashed if necessary3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered¾ to full 250 ml cup/bowl    a Note: If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1–2 cups of milk per day, and 1–2 extra meals per day.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/breastfeeding
58608394-75c5-4790-88a2-bf96f74f5409,"Why can’t we give water to a breastfeeding baby before the 6 months, even when it is hot?","Giving water to young babies puts them at risk of diarrhoea and
malnutrition. Water may not be clean and cause the baby to have
infections. Giving water may also cause the baby to drink less
breastmilk or to stop breastfeeding early and therefore cause
malnutrition. If mothers give water instead of breastfeeding it will
also cause the mother to have less milk in the future.
Breast milk is more than 80% water, especially the first milk
that comes with each feed. Therefore, whenever the mother feels her baby
is thirsty she can breastfeed him or her. This will satisfy the bay’s
thirst, and continue to protect the baby from infections, and help the
baby to continue to grow well. Babies do not need water before they are 6
months old, even in a hot climate. This is one of the reasons that WHO
recommends for children to be exclusively breastfed for the first 6
months of life.A child is considered exclusively breastfed when he or she
receives only breast milk, without any additional food or liquid, even
water, with the exception of oral rehydration solution, drops, syrups of
vitamins, minerals or medicines. When breastfeeding, the mother gives
her baby all the water he or she needs, while providing “safe water” and
protecting the baby against diarrhoea.  Related LinksInfant and young child feedingGlobal Strategy for Infant and Young Child FeedingThe WHO Child Growth Standards",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/breastfeeding

The end result would be a strategic document known as a target product profile (TPP).A TPP helps to shape the creation and evolution of the intended product, aligning the needs of end-users with the work that the system developers need to follow in order to satisfy these demands; it provides a possible starting point for the detailed discussions that the various stakeholders need to have in order to bring the product to a successful implementation within a country.Developers require TPPs early on within the production pathway. As a minimum, the TPPs should indicate the purpose of the functionality or system being developed, the goal/s to be met, who are the target end-users and the beneficiaries of the product, and what is the expected impact. The product should also achieve all the “minimal” and most of the “optimal” criteria which are set for each TPP.A TPP should be considered a “living document” which evolves as the project matures.

5887ac98-05dd-403d-bb68-f46969cc3ffd,Why are so many children involved in road traffic crashes?,"Children are at risk for road traffic injuries for a number of
reasons. Younger children are limited by their physical, cognitive and
social development, making them more vulnerable in road traffic than
adults. Because of their small stature, it can be difficult for children
to see surrounding traffic and for drivers and others to see them. In
addition if they are involved in a road traffic crash, their softer
heads make them more susceptible to serious head injury than adults.
Younger children may have difficulties interpreting various
sights and sounds, which may impact on their judgement regarding the
proximity, speed and direction of moving vehicles. Younger children may
also be impulsive, and their short attention spans mean that they
struggle to cope with more than one challenge at a time. As they grow
older, children of adolescent age are especially prone to take risks,
compromising their safety on the road. In general roads are planned
without sufficient consideration of the specific needs of children. Globally, around 186 300 children under 18 years die from road
traffic crashes annually, and road traffic injuries are the leading
killer of children aged 15-17 years worldwide. Two times as many boys as
girls die in road traffic crashes. In addition, rates of road traffic
death among children are 3 times higher in low- and middle-income
countries than in high-income countries. Road traffic injuries can be prevented. While no single
measure adequately addresses the vast range of risks to children on the
road, the ten strategies below are those which are best known -
especially when implemented as a package - to keep children safe on the
road. Controlling speedReducing drinking and drivingUsing helmets for bicyclists and motorcyclistsRestraining children in vehiclesImproving children's ability to see and be seenEnhancing road infrastructureAdapting vehicle designImplementing graduated driver licensingThese are discussed in detail in a new document called ""Ten strategies for keeping children safe on the road” published by WHO on the occasion of the Third United Nations Global Road Safety Week (4–10 May 2015).

The coming into force of the Convention is a major milestone in
efforts to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of
all human rights of people with disabilities. Countries should align
their policies and laws to the Convention, ensuring that these promote
autonomy, liberty, legal capacity, participation of people with mental
health conditions, as well as the range of services required for
independent community living.
Change attitudes and raise awareness. Ministries of
Health, organizations of people with mental health conditions, health
professionals, NGOs including Disabled Peoples’ Organizations academic
institutions, professional organizations and other stakeholders should
unify their efforts in educating and changing public attitudes towards
mental illness and in advocating for the rights of people with mental
disorders.
Improve human rights in mental health facilities. Ways to
assess quality of care and human rights conditions should be established
to protect against inhuman and degrading treatment, poor living
conditions and involuntary admission and treatment. People should be
able to file complaints in cases of human rights violations.
Empower people with mental health conditions and their families.
Governments should support creating and/or strengthening of
organizations of people with mental health conditions and as well as
family organizations. Such groups are in the best position to highlight
problems, specify their needs, and help find solutions to prevent
violations and improving mental health and other required services in
countries. They have a crucial role to play in the design and
implementation of policies, plans, laws and services.
Replace psychiatric institutions with community care.
Large institutions, which are so often associated with human rights
violations, should be replaced by community mental health care services,
backed by psychiatric beds in general hospital and home care support.
Mental health services need to link to services and supports in the
community, enabling people with mental health conditions to enjoy
educational, employment, social service and housing opportunities on an
equal basis with others.
Increase investment in mental health. Governments need to
dedicate more of their health budget to mental health. In addition the
mental health workforce at each level of the health care system needs to
be developed and trained to ensure that all people have access to good
quality mental health services that promote recovery and respect for
human rights.
The WHO QualityRights project aims to help countries to
achieve these goals. The project supports governments to assess and
improve quality and human rights conditions in mental health services.

HIA helps decision-makers make choices about alternatives and improvements to prevent disease/injury and to actively promote health. Whereas Health Technology Assessment is systematic evaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health technology and interventions. It is a multidisciplinary process to evaluate the clinical, social, economic, organizational and ethical issues of a health intervention or health technology. The main purpose of conducting an assessment is to inform a policy decision-making, especially on how best to allocate limited funds to health interventions and technologies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/health-technology-assessment

71f96d06-5a5c-424a-89dd-54ed5d679d09,Why is the Checklist important?,"Surgery can be a life-saving or life-changing intervention in many conditions and the provision of surgical services is being increasingly recognized as a significant public health issue. A modeling study estimated that 234 million operations are carried out every year across the world. This translates to one operation for every 25 people and is more than the number of children born worldwide each year.An estimation of the global volume of surgery: a modelling strategy based on available dataLancet 2008However, despite the positive impact the provision of surgical services can have on a population’s health, surgery itself carries risk. Current estimates of morbidity and mortality following surgery indicate that over 7 million people worldwide will suffer complications following surgery. One million of these people will die as a result. Around half of these complications are potentially preventable, so using the Checklist to improve the safety of surgery will save many thousands of lives each year.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions

This project’s goal was to improve the safety of patients undergoing surgical procedures around the world. The first step was to gather an international group of experts to develop a solution to the problem of unsafe surgery. Anaesthetists, operating theatre nurses, surgeons, safety experts, patients and other professionals came together and came up with the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist.All of the items included on the Checklist are supported by evidence that, if used reliably, can reduce complications from surgery.

The paper has many shortcomings, mainly that the authors did not know how often the Checklist was actually used and the period of the study was only three months, a very short time to expect to see a benefit.What we can learn from the study is that simply telling people to use the Checklist won’t work.

The original study suggests that it is multifactorial and that improvement could come from the Checklist, the formal pauses, the resultant push for uptake of technology, as well as improvements in teamwork and communication resulting from its use.One thing that is clear is that reductions in mortality and morbidity are greater when the Checklist is completed in full compared to when it is only partly completed.

Does the Checklist really apply to high-income countries?","Mortality was reduced with use of the Checklist in the hospitals situated in high-income countries, although the reductions were not statistically significant. However, it should be noted that the study was not powered to detect differences in mortality in each resource setting and complications were significantly reduced in all settings.Since the pilot study, many other studies in high-income settings have shown a reduction in both complications and deaths following surgery where the Checklist has been used.The Checklist definitely has benefits for surgical patients in high-income countries, therefore.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions
669dac72-a1f1-48f3-aecb-2f9771d1a98c,Does the Checklist apply to all low- and middle-income countries?,"Four low-income countries contributed to the original WHO study and reductions in complications and deaths were observed in all those settings. Since then, other studies have found similar benefits in a variety of low- and middle- income countries. Adapted appropriately, the Checklist can be an effective tool in these settings, especially when adopted as part of a wider push for improvement in the overall patient safety culture.WHO acknowledges that implementation of the Checklist in low- and middle-income settings will imply special considerations. Limited availability of resources may make certain items harder to follow, for example antibiotic prophylaxis and pulse oximeter use. Efforts should, and are, being made to make these important products more widely available.

There is no need to repeat introductions if they have already been made. However, if new members join a room, they should introduce themselves as should every member of the team present. Even if everyone knows each other, introductions are important as they serve to reinforce team communication.An important part of the introductions is to enable every member of the team to speak aloud when they introduce themselves.

278e54cf-82cc-44a0-87f9-007bd14d700a,"Know the IHR; purpose, scope, principles and concepts","The International Health Regulations (2005) (hereinafter ""the IHR"" or “the Regulations”) are an international agreement that is legally binding on 194 countries (States Parties), including all WHO Member States. The IHR define their ""purpose and scope"" as: ""to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade"". Since their entry into force on 15 June 2007, the IHR directs and governs particular WHO and States Parties activities aiming that protect the global community from public health risks and emergencies that cross international borders.These activities are implemented in ways that are consistent with other international law and agreements; their implementation must ""be with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedom of persons"" and ""guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease"".The scope of the IHR is purposely broad and inclusive in respect of the public health event to which they have application in order to maximize the probability that all such events that could have serious international consequences are identified early and promptly reported by States Parties to WHO for assessment. The Regulations aim to provide a legal frame work for the prevention, detection and containment of public health risks at source, before they spread across borders, through the collaborative actions of States Parties and WHO.Notification is required under IHR for all ""events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern"". In this regard, the broad new definitions of ""event"", ""disease"" and ""public health risk"" in the IHR are the building blocks of the surveillance obligations for States Parties and WHO. ""Disease"" means ""an illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source, that presents or could present significant harm to humans"". The term ""event"" is broadly defined as ""a manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease"". ""Public health risk"" refers to ""a likelihood of an event that may affect adversely the health of human populations, with an emphasis on one which may spread internationally or may present a serious and direct danger"". A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is defined as ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"". Consequently, events of potential international concern, which require States Parties to notify WHO, can extend beyond communicable diseases and arise from any origin or source.The IHR explicitly allow WHO to take into account information from sources other than official notifications and consultations, and, after assessment, to seek verification of specific events from the concerned States Parties. Notification to WHO marks the beginning of an exclusive dialogue between the notifying State Party and WHO on further event assessment, potential investigation and any appropriate local or global public health response.The responsibility for implementing the IHR rests jointly with States Parties and WHO. In order to be able to notify events, or respond to public health risks and emergencies, States Parties must have the capacity to detect such events through a well established national surveillance and response infrastructure. States Parties are required to collaborate actively with each other, together with WHO, to mobilize the financial resources to facilitate the implementation of their obligations under the IHR. Upon request, WHO assists developing countries in mobilizing financial resources and provides technical support to build, strengthen and maintain the capacities set out in Annex 1 of the Regulations.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations
16bee88b-1c12-41e6-bec1-3f1a277daa9f,Update national legislation,"An adequate legal framework to support and enable all of the varied IHR State Party activities is needed in each country. In some countries, giving effect to the IHR within domestic jurisdiction and national law requires that the relevant authorities adopt implementing legislation for some or all of the relevant rights and obligations for States Parties. However, even where new or revised legislation may not be explicitly required under a country's legal system for implementation of one or more provisions in the IHR, revision of some legislation, regulations or other instruments may still be considered by the country in order to facilitate performance of IHR activities in a more efficient, effective or otherwise beneficial manner. Additionally, from a policy perspective, implementing legislation may serve to institutionalize and strengthen the role of IHR capacities and operations within the State Party, as well as the ability to exercise certain rights contained in the Regulations. A further potential benefit from such legislation is that it can facilitate necessary coordination among the different entities involved in implementation and help to ensure continuity. For these reasons, States Parties to the IHR should consider assessing their relevant existing legislation to determine whether they may be appropriate for revision in order to facilitate full and efficient implementation of the Regulations.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations
8cc9ae30-1c15-42f5-ba58-f057119ccaeb,Recognize shared realities and the need for collective defences,"The recognition that globalisation brings with it new challenges and opportunities for preventing the international spread of disease was the starting point for the revision of the International Health Regulations (1969) or ""IHR (1969)"". In 2003, the outbreak and eventual control of SARS convinced the world's governments of the necessity for a collective and coordinated defence against emerging public health threats, providing the impetus needed to complete the revision process. The IHR were adopted by the Health Assembly on 23 May 2005, and entered into force on 15 June 2007.The IHR legal framework supports existing and innovative approaches in the global detection of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. The current Regulations were built in part on the foundations of their predecessor, the IHR (1969), and were primarily based on the experiences of WHO and its Member States in national surveillance systems, epidemic intelligence, verification, risk assessment, outbreak alert, and coordination of international response, all of which are part of WHO’s decade-long work to enhance global public health security.In contrast to the IHR (1969), the current Regulations have a broad scope, provide for the use of a wide range of information and emphasize collaborative actions between States Parties and WHO in the identification and assessment of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. In WHO's coordination of the international response to public health emergencies of international concern, maximum measures are replaced by formally recommended and context-specific temporary health measures, tailored to the actual threat faced.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations

To date, this requirement has been fulfilled through annual reporting by the WHO Secretariat to its governing bodies. Using information gathered through questionnaires, the WHO Secretariat has summarized the activities carried by countries to implement the IHR. It is anticipated that, in the future, this data will be collected using specific indicators currently under development. In addition to this, the IHR Coordination Department collaborates closely with WHO Regional Offices and other relevant departments and programmes to report on WHO’s work in support of IHR implementation.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations
592c3a66-fca1-4f7d-889d-faf3c5e20311,"Notify, report, consult and inform WHO","The IHR describe key elements of the procedures to be followed by States Parties and WHO in terms of information sharing with regard to notified events. Official event-related communications under the IHR are carried out between the National IHR Focal Point and their corresponding regional WHO IHR Contact Point, both of whom are officially designated and required to be available on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week.The IHR (2005) specify three ways in which States Parties can initiate event-related communications with WHO:Notification – Under the IHR, States Parties are required to notify WHO of all events that are assessed as possibly constituting a PHEIC, taking into account the context in which an event occurs. These notifications must occur within 24 hours of assessment by the country using the decision instrument provided in Annex 2 of the Regulations. This decision instrument identifies four criteria that States Parties must follow in their assessment of events within their territories and their decision as to whether an event is notifiable to WHO:Is the public health impact of the event serious?Is the event unusual or unexpected?Is there a significant risk of international spread?Is there a significant risk of international restriction(s) to travel and trade?Notifications must be followed by ongoing communication of detailed public health information on the event, including, where possible, case definition, laboratory results, source and type of the risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease and the health measures employed.Consultation - In cases where the State Party is unable to complete a definitive assessment with the decision instrument in Annex 2, State Parties have an explicit option of initiating confidential consultations with WHO and seeking advice on evaluation, assessment and appropriate health measures to be taken.Other Reports - State Parties must inform WHO through the National IHR Focal Point within 24 hours of receipt of evidence of a public health risk identified outside their territory that may cause international disease spread, as manifested by imported or exported human cases, vectors which carry infection or contamination, or by contaminated goods.In addition to these three types of communications, States Parties are required under the IHR to respond to WHO Requests for Verification. WHO has an express mandate to obtain verification from States Parties concerning unofficial reports or communications, received from various sources, about events arising within their territories which may constitute a PHEIC; these reports are initially reviewed by WHO prior to the issuing of a verification request. States Parties must acknowledge verification requests by WHO within 24 hours and provide public health information on the status of the event, followed, in a timely manner, by continued communication of accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to the notifying State Party.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations
adfcb41a-ade7-48ce-bdb7-0b29356113c0,"Understand WHO’s role in international event detection, joint assessment and response","The IHR underpin WHO’s mandate to manage the international response to acute public health events and risks, including public health emergencies of international concern. The Regulations also recognize WHO's general surveillance obligations, and set out specific procedures for concerned States Parties and WHO to collaborate in the assessment and control of public health events and risks, even before such events have been officially notified to WHO.At the international level, WHO’s real-time analysis of public health events uses technical knowledge, an understanding of the situational and operational context, and risk communication requirements to assess public health risks in accordance with WHO’s mandate under the IHR. To further strengthen international alert and response capabilities, an enhanced event-management system and standard operating procedures have been developed by WHO. This web-based tool functions as the official repository of all information relevant to an event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. It facilitates communications within WHO, with National IHR Focal Points, with technical institutions and partners, and provides timely public health information for the management of these events and risks.Information relating to public health risks notified or reported under the IHR (2005) to WHO is jointly assessed with the affected State Party to ascertain the nature and extent of the risk, the potential for international disease spread and interference with travel and trade, and appropriate response and containment strategies.In order to meet its IHR obligations and to facilitate information sharing between the Organization and States Parties to the Regulations, WHO has established an IHR Event Information Site.

Indeed, since the entry into force of the IHR on 15 June 2007 only one such determination has been made and recommendations issued. It is important that States Parties to the IHR are aware of the processes that may affect them and of their right to be consulted and present their views.If immediate global action is needed to provide a public health response to prevent or control the international spread of disease, the IHR give the Director-General of WHO the authority to determine that the event constitutes a PHEIC. On such occasions, an IHR Emergency Committee provides its views to the Director-General on temporary recommendations on the most appropriate and necessary public health measures to respond to the emergency. A State Party affected by a potential emergency needs to work closely with WHO to ensure that all relevant information and considerations are brought to bear prior such a determination and the adoption of any corresponding temporary recommendations. However, the right of a State to be consulted or prevent its views to an Emergency Committee shall be without prejudice to the need to act swiftly in the event of an emergency.In cases where the State Party concerned may not agree that a PHEIC is occurring, the Emergency Committee will also provide advice.

38317663-c74c-48ef-8ad9-d6f9c12973b6,Strengthen national surveillance and response capacities,"Another fundamental aspect of the IHR is the obligation for all States Parties to develop, strengthen and maintain core public health capacities for surveillance and response. In order to be able to detect, assess, notify and report events and respond to public health risks and emergencies of international concern, States Parties must meet the requirements described in Annex 1A of the IHR (2005). Annex 1A outlines these core capacities at the local (community), intermediate and national levels, including, at the national level, the assessment of all reports of urgent events within 48 hours and the immediate reporting to WHO through the National IHR Focal Point, when required.The IHR require each State Party, with the support of WHO, to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements ""as soon as possible"", but not later than five years after the date of entry into force for that country. The IHR set out a two-phase process to assist States Parties to plan for the implementation of their public health capacity obligations. In the first phase, from 15 June 2007 to 15 June 2009, States Parties must assess the ability of their existing national structures and resources to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements. This assessment must lead to the development and implementation of national plans of action. As specified in the IHR, WHO must support these assessments and provide guidance on the national planning and implementation of these capacity strengthening plans.In the second phase from 15 June 2009 to 15 June 2012, the national action plans are expected to be implemented by each State Party to ensure that core capacities are present and functioning throughout the country and/or its relevant territories. States Parties that experience difficulties in implementing their plans may request an additional two year period until 15 June 2014 to meet their Annex 1A obligations. On the basis of a justified need, an extension of two years may be obtained. In exceptional circumstances, and supported by a new implementation plan, the Director-General of WHO may grant an individual State Party a further extension not exceeding two years to meet its obligations.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations

For this reason, many of the provisions addressing this aspect in the IHR (1969) have been updated in the IHR (2005). A number of new provisions have been included. When applying IHR-related health measures to international travellers, for example, it is required that they be treated with courtesy and respect, taking into consideration their gender, sociocultural, ethnic and religious concerns. They must be supplied with appropriate food, water, accommodation and medical treatment if quarantined, isolated or otherwise subject to medical or public health measures under the IHR (2005).States Parties are required to designate the international airports and ports and any ground crossings which will develop specific capacities in the application of the public health measures required to manage a variety of public health risks. These capacities include access to appropriate medical services (with diagnostic facilities), services for the transport of ill persons, trained personnel to inspect ships, aircraft and other conveyances, maintenance of a healthy environment as well as ensuring plans and facilities to apply emergency measures such as quarantine.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations

7cfdc8cc-454c-4ffc-ab88-c90787944b14,Is harmful use of alcohol a public health problem?,"Yes, the harmful use of alcohol is an important public health problem. It impacts people and societies in many ways.
It is well known that there is a causal relationship between
alcohol consumption and a range of mental and behavioural disorders,
including alcohol dependence, other noncommunicable conditions such as
liver diseases, some cancers, cardiovascular diseases, as well as
injuries resulting from violence and road accidents. Furthermore, there
are causal relationships between harmful use of alcohol and incidence of
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia, as well as the
course of HIV/AIDS. More than this, harmful use of alcohol creates
considerable negative health and social consequences for people other
than the drinker.
Current estimates of alcohol-related diseases only partly
reveal the impact of harmful alcohol use. Accumulating evidence suggests
a link between harmful use of alcohol and such infectious diseases as
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Such relationships have to be proven and
quantified before global burden of disease estimates attributable to
alcohol can be adjusted accordingly. Harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200
diseases and injuries. In 2012, 5.1% of the global disease burden was
due to the harmful use of alcohol, and an estimated 3.3 million people
died from alcohol related conditions that year.
Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings
significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at
large. In countries with lower economic wealth the morbidity and
mortality risks are higher per litre of pure alcohol consumed than in
the higher income countries.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/alcohol-harmful-use-of-alcohol

The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species.

6c1ca345-25ec-4f96-90b5-2b5388d8bcee,Why are GM foods produced?,"GM foods are developed – and marketed – because there is some perceived advantage either to the producer or consumer of these foods. This is meant to translate into a product with a lower price, greater benefit (in terms of durability or nutritional value) or both. Initially GM seed developers wanted their products to be accepted by producers and have concentrated on innovations that bring direct benefit to farmers (and the food industry generally).
One of the objectives for developing plants based on GM organisms is to improve crop protection. The GM crops currently on the market are mainly aimed at an increased level of crop protection through the introduction of resistance against plant diseases caused by insects or viruses or through increased tolerance towards herbicides.
Resistance against insects is achieved by incorporating into the food plant the gene for toxin production from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This toxin is currently used as a conventional insecticide in agriculture and is safe for human consumption. GM crops that inherently produce this toxin have been shown to require lower quantities of insecticides in specific situations, e.g. where pest pressure is high. Virus resistance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from certain viruses which cause disease in plants. Virus resistance makes plants less susceptible to diseases caused by such viruses, resulting in higher crop yields.
Herbicide tolerance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium conveying resistance to some herbicides. In situations where weed pressure is high, the use of such crops has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the herbicides used.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-genetically-modified
48334926-f2a2-4dba-a491-fa7af04cae53,Is the safety of GM foods assessed differently from conventional foods?,"Generally consumers consider that conventional foods (that have an established record of safe consumption over the history) are safe. Whenever novel varieties of organisms for food use are developed using the traditional breeding methods that had existed before the introduction of gene technology, some of the characteristics of organisms may be altered, either in a positive or a negative way. National food authorities may be called upon to examine the safety of such conventional foods obtained from novel varieties of organisms, but this is not always the case.
In contrast, most national authorities consider that specific assessments are necessary for GM foods. Specific systems have been set up for the rigorous evaluation of GM organisms and GM foods relative to both human health and the environment. Similar evaluations are generally not performed for conventional foods. Hence there currently exists a significant difference in the evaluation process prior to marketing for these two groups of food.
The WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses aims at assisting national authorities in the identification of foods that should be subject to risk assessment and to recommend appropriate approaches to safety assessment. Should national authorities decide to conduct safety assessment of GM organisms, WHO recommends the use of Codex Alimentarius guidelines (See the answer to Question 11 below).",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-genetically-modified

4883b516-cfd1-43cf-83c4-4346d9591901,What are the main issues of concern for human health?,"While theoretical discussions have covered a broad range of aspects, the three main issues debated are the potentials to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity), gene transfer and outcrossing.
Allergenicity
As a matter of principle, the transfer of genes from commonly allergenic organisms to non-allergic organisms is discouraged unless it can be demonstrated that the protein product of the transferred gene is not allergenic. While foods developed using traditional breeding methods are not generally tested for allergenicity, protocols for the testing of GM foods have been evaluated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO. No allergic effects have been found relative to GM foods currently on the market.
Gene transfer
Gene transfer from GM foods to cells of the body or to bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract would cause concern if the transferred genetic material adversely affects human health. This would be particularly relevant if antibiotic resistance genes, used as markers when creating GMOs, were to be transferred. Although the probability of transfer is low, the use of gene transfer technology that does not involve antibiotic resistance genes is encouraged.
Outcrossing
The migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or related species in the wild (referred to as “outcrossing”), as well as the mixing of crops derived from conventional seeds with GM crops, may have an indirect effect on food safety and food security. Cases have been reported where GM crops approved for animal feed or industrial use were detected at low levels in the products intended for human consumption. Several countries have adopted strategies to reduce mixing, including a clear separation of the fields within which GM crops and conventional crops are grown.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-genetically-modified

Codex developed principles for the human health risk analysis of GM foods in 2003.


Principles for the risk analysis of foods derived from modern biotechnology


The premise of these principles sets out a premarket assessment, performed on a caseby- case basis and including an evaluation of both direct effects (from the inserted gene) and unintended effects (that may arise as a consequence of insertion of the new gene) Codex also developed three Guidelines:


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA plants


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods produced using recombinant-DNA microorganisms


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA animals


Codex principles do not have a binding effect on national legislation, but are referred to specifically in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization (SPS Agreement), and WTO Members are encouraged to harmonize national standards with Codex standards. If trading partners have the same or similar mechanisms for the safety assessment of GM foods, the possibility that one product is approved in one country but rejected in another becomes smaller.
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an environmental treaty legally binding for its Parties which took effect in 2003, regulates transboundary movements of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). GM foods are within the scope of the Protocol only if they contain LMOs that are capable of transferring or replicating genetic material.

54f20e8f-7d47-4a83-8daa-6b8d0a84b7ad,"Why has there been concern about GM foods among some politicians, public interest groups and consumers?","Since the first introduction on the market in the mid-1990s of a major GM food (herbicide-resistant soybeans), there has been concern about such food among politicians, activists and consumers, especially in Europe. Several factors are involved. In the late 1980s – early 1990s, the results of decades of molecular research reached the public domain. Until that time, consumers were generally not very aware of the potential of this research. In the case of food, consumers started to wonder about safety because they perceive that modern biotechnology is leading to the creation of new species.
Consumers frequently ask, “what is in it for me?”. Where medicines are concerned, many consumers more readily accept biotechnology as beneficial for their health (e.g. vaccines, medicines with improved treatment potential or increased safety). In the case of the first GM foods introduced onto the European market, the products were of no apparent direct benefit to consumers (not significantly cheaper, no increased shelflife, no better taste). The potential for GM seeds to result in bigger yields per cultivated area should lead to lower prices. However, public attention has focused on the risk side of the risk-benefit equation, often without distinguishing between potential environmental impacts and public health effects of GMOs.
Consumer confidence in the safety of food supplies in Europe has decreased significantly as a result of a number of food scares that took place in the second half of the 1990s that are unrelated to GM foods. This has also had an impact on discussions about the acceptability of GM foods. Consumers have questioned the validity of risk assessments, both with regard to consumer health and environmental risks, focusing in particular on long-term effects. Other topics debated by consumer organizations have included allergenicity and antimicrobial resistance. Consumer concerns have triggered a discussion on the desirability of labelling GM foods, allowing for an informed choice of consumers.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/food-genetically-modified
8184da10-7ba0-42b0-b971-cff054963a97,What is the state of public debate on GMOs?,"The release of GMOs into the environment and the marketing of GM foods have resulted in a public debate in many parts of the world. This debate is likely to continue, probably in the broader context of other uses of biotechnology (e.g. in human medicine) and their consequences for human societies. Even though the issues under debate are usually very similar (costs and benefits, safety issues), the outcome of the debate differs from country to country. On issues such as labelling and traceability of GM foods as a way to address consumer preferences, there is no worldwide consensus to date.

Sustainable agriculture and biodiversity benefit most from the use of a rich variety of crops, both in terms of good crop protection practices as well as from the perspective of society at large and the values attached to food. These groups fear that as a result of the interest of the chemical industry in seed markets, the range of varieties used by farmers may be reduced mainly to GM crops. This would impact on the food basket of a society as well as in the long run on crop protection (for example, with the development of resistance against insect pests and tolerance of certain herbicides). The exclusive use of herbicide-tolerant GM crops would also make the farmer dependent on these chemicals.

on the grounds that public health could benefit from the potential of biotechnology, for example, from an increase in the nutrient content of foods, decreased allergenicity and more efficient and/or sustainable food production; and


based on the need to examine the potential negative effects on human health of the consumption of food produced through genetic modification in order to protect public health. Modern technologies should be thoroughly evaluated if they are to constitute a true improvement in the way food is produced.


WHO, together with FAO, has convened several expert consultations on the evaluation of GM foods and provided technical advice for the Codex Alimentarius Commission which was fed into the Codex Guidelines on safety assessment of GM foods.

24f55244-2940-43ba-acc2-fdee6c947de5,How common are headaches?,"Headaches are extremely common. Nearly everyone has a headache
occasionally. When they occur repeatedly, they are a symptom of a
headache disorder. The most common headache disorder is tension-type
headache. In developed countries, tension-type headache affects over one
third of men and over one half of women. Recent studies suggest the
same in developing countries. Less well recognized is the toll of
headache disorders characterized by very frequent headache: up to 1
adult in 20 has a headache every – or nearly every – day.
Migraine is also very common affecting at least 1 adult in
every 7 in the world. It occurs across all continents, but for reasons
not yet known appears to be somewhat less common in the Far East. It is
up to 3 times more common in women than men, a pattern seen everywhere.
This difference is hormonally-driven. Migraine has been better studied
than other headache disorders. Often starting at puberty, migraine most
affects those aged between 35 and 45 years but can trouble much younger
people, including children. Headache disorders are painful and disabling. They can cause
substantial personal suffering, impaired quality of life and high
financial cost. Repeated headache attacks – and often the constant fear
of the next one – can affect family life, social life and employment.
Despite this, many people – including many health care professionals –
tend to perceive headache as a minor or trivial complaint. As a result,
the physical, emotional, social and economic burdens of headaches are
poorly acknowledged.For the vast majority of people suffering from headache,
effective treatment requires no expensive equipment, tests or
specialists. Headache disorders are mostly, and rightly, managed in
primary health care. The essential components of effective management
are awareness of the problem, correct diagnosis, avoidance of
mismanagement, appropriate lifestyle modifications and informed use of
cost-effective pharmaceutical remedies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/headache-disorders-how-common-are-headaches

This analysis follows the standard WHO-CHOICE approach to generalized cost-effectiveness analysis applied to two regions, Eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. The scope of the analysis is all interventions included in programme specific WHO-CHOICE analyses, using WHO treatment guidelines for major disease areas as the foundation. Costs are measured in 2010 international dollars, and benefits modelled beginning in 2010, or the nearest year for which validated data was available, both for a period of 100 years. We observe that, across both regions included in the analysis, interventions span multiple orders of magnitude in terms of cost-effectiveness ratios. A health benefit package optimized through a value for money lens incorporates interventions responding to all the main drivers of disease burden. Interventions delivered through first level clinical and nonclinical services represent most of the high impact cost-effective interventions. Therefore, in conclusion cost-effectiveness is one important criterion when selecting health interventions for benefit packages to progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), but it is not the only criterion, and all calculations should be adapted to the local context.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/who-choice-frequently-asked-questions
e48a09fe-5cc2-4961-83ae-00712da89c91,Should tetanus immunizations be given to survivors with injuries in emergency situations?,"In emergency situations where there are serious injuries, tetanus immunization has to be taken into consideration.As tetanus is a complication of wounds and injuries, it is essential that injured people receive appropriate surgical and medical care of contaminated open wounds. Open wounds must be considered as contaminated and should not be closed. Debridement and removal of dead tissue and debris is essential, and depending on the size of the wound may necessitate a surgical procedure undertaken in appropriate conditions. Wounds should be dressed with sterile dressings and the patient scheduled for delayed primary closure.Tetanus immunization is usually provided to victims of natural disasters on an as-needed basis for several reasons.Types of tetanus vaccinesTT - Tetanus Toxoid vaccineDTP - Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccineDT - Diphtheria toxoid and Tetanus toxoid vaccineTd - Tetanus toxoid and Diphtheria toxoid vaccine (low dose diphtheria)First, it is not communicable from person-to-person.Second, in many parts of the world, most people have already some protection against tetanus through immunization.In summary, tetanus prevention can be achieved during emergencies through:Careful cleaning of wounds, both deep and superficial, can substantially decrease the risk of tetanus. Protecting cleaned wounds from recontamination with dressings, and/or topical disinfectants also is important.Protective clothing and closed shoes, if available, should be worn by anyone engaged in clearing away or sifting through debris.If possible, TT vaccination should be offered to anyone engaged in debris clean-up and construction. For those who have not received TT in the past, or for whom past vaccination is uncertain, a second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first. The first dose will not provide protection to those who have not previously been vaccinated, but will rather prime the body to produce anti-tetanus immunity with the second dose given at-least 4 weeks later.If feasible, vaccination with TT-containing vaccine should be offered to all internally displaced people who have not received at least 3 previous doses.Because tetanus risk is high in disaster areas, and because the immunization status of most persons will be unknown, it will be worthwhile to provide doses of TT-containing vaccine, even if only one dose can be assured.Tetanus immunoglobulins may be required for managing those with deep wounds.In emergencies where prior tetanus toxoid immunization levels were low, special attention should be given to preventing maternal and neonatal tetanus, by immunizing women of childbearing age and by improving the hygienic conditions under which childbirths take place. Routine immunization of women and children should also be re-established as soon as possible.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tetanus-immunization
dd7066a1-4d24-4f4a-9512-41f34d993a6f,Q: What health challenges do preterm babies face?,"The earlier in a pregnancy that babies are born, the less prepared their bodies are for the outside world. They need special care to overcome the following challenges:Staying warm: Preterm babies lose body heat more easily, putting them at risk of life-threatening hypothermia. They need extra energy and care to stay warm and grow.Feeding: Preterm babies can have trouble feeding because the coordinated suck and swallow reflex is not yet fully developed. They may need additional support for feeding.Breathing: Many preterm babies start breathing on their own when they are born, but others need to be resuscitated. If the lungs are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs expanded), preterm babies may have difficulty breathing. Sometimes, premature babies that start off breathing are not strong enough to continue on their own. They exhaust themselves and may stop breathing (apnoea).Infections: Severe infections are more common among preterm babies. Their immune systems are not yet fully developed, and they have a higher risk of dying if they get an infection.Brain: Preterm babies are at risk of bleeding in the brain, during birth and in the first few days after birth; about 1 in 5 babies weighing less than 2kg have this problem. Preterm babies can also have brain injuries from a lack of oxygen. Bleeding or lack of oxygen to the brain can result in result in cerebral palsy, developmental delays and learning difficulties.Eyes: Preterm babies’ eyes are not ready for the outside world. They can be damaged by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. The condition is usually more severe in very premature babies and if they are given too-high a level of oxygen.

This includes:Good pregnancy care:All pregnant women should receive good care, including at least four antenatal visits with a health worker.Mothers at risk of preterm birth (e.g. those who have had a preterm birth before) need to be aware that it may happen again, and plan accordingly.Health workers caring for pregnant women need to assess their risk of delivering preterm and be able to recognize and manage conditions that can lead to preterm birth (e.g. pre-eclampsia, a condition in pregnancy that causes the mother to have high blood pressure).Women in preterm labour should give birth at a health facility where they and their babies can get the care they need. They may need to be referred to a hospital where more advanced care is available, and the safest time to do this is when the baby is still in the womb.Delivery by caesarean section or early induction of labour that is not medically necessary should be avoided.Women in preterm labour, before 34 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, should receive steroid injections to speed up the development of the baby’s lungs.Essential newborn care:All babies need to be protected from infections: everyone who touches the mother or the baby should have clean hands. Medical examinations and procedures should only be done if necessary. Sterile gloves and cutting devices should be used for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord.All babies need to be kept warm: right after birth, they should be dried thoroughly and placed on their mother’s abdomen. If they breathe normally, and after the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut, they should be put on their mother’s chest, with skin-to-skin contact, until after the first breastfeed. They should not be bathed right away.Most babies will breathe normally after thorough drying. Those who do not start breathing on their own need help: ventilation with a bag and mask will usually put them back on track.Breast is best: just like full-term babies, breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm babies. Babies should be breastfed as soon as possible after birth. Most premature babies who are unable to coordinate the suck and swallow reflex can be fed their mother’s expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or nasogastric tube.Extra care for small babies:Preterm babies, and full-term babies with low birth weight need extra warmth and support for feeding.Kangaroo Mother Care is a good way of doing this.Care for preterm babies with complications:Babies who have infections need treatment with antibiotics.Babies who do not breathe when they are born need basic newborn resuscitation; if breathing problems persist, they may need additional support from a machine (ventilator) and extra oxygen.Babies who have additional complications may need to be kept in neonatal intensive care, where that is available.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/newborn-health-caring-for-preterm-babies

when the eye cannot clearly focus the images from the outside world. The
result of refractive errors is blurred vision, which is sometimes so
severe that it causes visual impairment.
The four most common refractive errors are:myopia (nearsightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly;hyperopia (farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly; astigmatism: distorted vision resulting from an irregularly curved cornea, the clear covering of the eyeball.presbyopia: which leads to difficulty in reading or seeing at
arm's length, it is linked to ageing and occurs almost universally.Refractive errors cannot be prevented, but they can be
diagnosed by an eye examination and treated with corrective glasses,
contact lenses or refractive surgery. If corrected in time and by
eye-care professionals, they do not impede the full development of good
visual function. Correction is provided in different forms according to
the defect, the age f the person, the requirements in terms of work of
activity performed.
WHO estimates that 153 million people worldwide live with
visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors. This figure does
not include the people living with uncorrected presbyopia, which is
likely to be quite significant, according to some early evidence.WHO, its Member States and partners are working to find ways
to provide good quality, professionally prescribed, local, affordable

e63ff603-bada-43c1-b5d6-e59e2ab3d14f,What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?,"This is a question which WHO takes very seriously. Given the
immense number of people who use mobile phones, even a small increase in
the incidence of adverse effects on health could have major public
health implications.
Because exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by
mobile phones is generally more than a 1000 times higher than from base
stations, and the greater likelihood of any adverse effect being due to
handsets, research has almost exclusively been conducted on possible
effects of mobile phone exposure. Research has concentrated on the following areas: cancerother health effectselectromagnetic interferencetraffic accidents. CancerBased on mixed epidemiological evidence on humans regarding an
association between exposure to RF radiation from wireless phones and
head cancers (glioma and acoustic neuroma), RF fields have been
classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as
possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). Studies to date provide no
indication that environmental exposure to RF fields, such as from base
stations, increases the risk of cancer or any other disease. Other health effectsScientists have reported other health effects of using mobile
phones including changes in brain activity, reaction times, and sleep
patterns. These effects are minor and have no apparent health
significance. More studies are underway to try to confirm these
findings. Electromagnetic interferenceWhen mobile phones are used very close to some medical devices
(including pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and certain hearing
aids) there is the possibility of causing interference with their
operation. The risk is much reduced for 3G phones and newer equipment.
There is also the potential of interference between mobile phones
signals and aircraft electronics. Some countries have licensed mobile
phone use on aircraft during flight using systems that control the phone
output power.Traffic accidentsResearch has shown an increased risk of traffic accidents,
some 3-4 times greater chance of an accident, when mobile phones (either
handheld or with a ""hands-free"" kit) are used while driving due to
distraction. ConclusionsWhile an increased risk of brain tumours from the use of
mobile phones is not established, the increasing use of mobile phones
and the lack of data for mobile phone use over time periods longer than
15 years warrant further research of mobile phone use and brain cancer
risk. In particular, with the recent popularity of mobile phone use
among younger people, and therefore a potentially longer lifetime of
exposure, WHO has promoted further research on this group and is
currently assessing the health impact of RF fields on all studied
endpoints.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/what-are-the-health-risks-associated-with-mobile-phones-and-their-base-stations

ease of use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such
as the Internet, by people with disability. Web sites need to be
developed so that disabled users can access the information. For
example:
for people who are blind, web sites need to be able to be
interpreted by programmes which read text aloud and describe any visual
images; for people who have low vision, web pages need adjustable sized fonts and sharply contrasting colours; and for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, audio content should
be accompanied by text versions of the dialogue. Sign language video can
also help make audio content more accessible.
Internationally, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
prepared by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provide standards for
web accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities, which came into force on May 3, 2008 draws attention to
the need to ensure access to ICTs for people with disability on an
equal basis with others and will help to eliminate barriers to
information, including through the Internet. At the national level, laws
and regulations can promote compliance with accessibility standards.The use of ICTs, such as the Internet, is rapidly becoming an
essential part of the economic, educational and social life of many

The dilemma for most countries, in particular low-income countries, is that they are not able to provide everyone with all the health services they need at an affordable price, even with the large increases in external donor assistance for health since 2000.
The goal should be to provide an increasing number of health services over time while at the same time reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients. Decisions about the services that can be guaranteed to the population initially, and which ones should be added over time, are based on peoples’ needs, public opinion and costs.

59a662fd-51e2-4cec-aece-48a653fe5fbc,How can we measure universal health coverage?,"As universal health coverage is a combination of whether people obtain the health services they need and financial risk protection, measurement needs to include both components. Coverage of health services can be measured by the percentage of people receiving the services they need: for example women in fertile age groups accessing modern methods of family planning or children immunized. On the other hand, financial risk protection can be evaluated by a reduction in the number of families pushed into poverty or placed under severe economic strain due to health costs. The impact of these steps on population health and household financial wellbeing can also be measured, as can many of the factors that make it easier to increase coverage. These include the availability of essential medicines, for example.
The main challenge is that many countries do not have the capacity to measure coverage of all of the many health interventions that their populations needs. So they will need to choose a set of key indicators to track performance in service coverage. A sub-set of these could be used to compare performance between countries.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-universal-health-coverage

Access and use of health services enables people to be more productive and active contributors to their families and communities. It also ensures that children can go to school and learn. At the same time, financial risk protection prevents people from being pushed into poverty when they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets.
Universal health coverage is thus a critical component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key element of any effort to reduce social inequities.

05eaafa1-fd24-47d8-8723-3eb8df2cfbc6,Is it true that lack of iodine really causes brain damage?,"Iodine deficiency is the main cause of brain damage in
childhood. It results in impaired cognitive and motor development which
affects a child’s performance at school. In adulthood, it affects
productivity and the ability to find a job. Iodine-deficient people may
forfeit 15 IQ points, and nearly 50 million people suffer from some
degree of iodine deficiency-related brain damage.
It is particularly important that pregnant women receive
enough iodine in their diet, as iodine is a key nutrient in the fetal
development process, especially with respect to the brain. Iodine
deficiency during pregnancy not only results in brain damage to the
fetus, but also in low birth weight, prematurity and increased perinatal
and infant mortality. Young children are also particularly at risk because the brain
still needs iodine for its development during the first two years of
life. In addition, iodine deficiency in children is responsible for
disorders in physical and cognitive development, and hypothyroidism.
The latest global estimate is that 1.88 billion people,
including 241 million school-age children have insufficient dietary
iodine intake (1). Even if iodine deficiency may be more severe in
developing countries, it equally affects developed and developing
countries.Iodine deficiency can easily be prevented at low cost. One of
the best and least expensive methods of preventing iodine deficiency
disorder is by simply iodizing table salt, which is currently done in
many countries. Where salt iodization has been in place for at least a
year, improvement in iodine status within the population has been
overwhelming. It is because of these adverse effects on brain development
that the 58th World Health Assembly passed a resolution to urge a
renewed effort from the international community, including WHO and
UNICEF, to address iodine deficiency in the 54 countries most affected.
Efforts include:developing strong commitment from public heath authoritieseducation of the publiceffective collaboration with all partners involved especially the salt industrya good monitoring system to make sure that salt is adequately iodizednational legislations on iodized salt that are enforced.

These inequities arise from inequalities within and between societies. Social and economic conditions and their effects on people’s lives determine their risk of illness and the actions taken to prevent them becoming ill or treat illness when it occurs.Examples of health inequities between countries:the infant mortality rate (the risk of a baby dying between birth and one year of age) is 2 per 1000 live births in Iceland and over 120 per 1000 live births in Mozambique;the lifetime risk of maternal death during or shortly after pregnancy is only 1 in 17 400 in Sweden but it is 1 in 8 in Afghanistan.Examples of health inequities within countries:in Bolivia, babies born to women with no education have infant mortality greater than 100 per 1000 live births, while the infant mortality rate of babies born to mothers with at least secondary education is under 40 per 1000;life expectancy at birth among indigenous Australians is substantially lower (59.4 for males and 64.8 for females) than that of non-indigenous Australians (76.6 and 82.0, respectively);life expectancy at birth for men in the Calton neighbourhood of Glasgow is 54 years, 28 years less than that of men in Lenzie, a few kilometres away;the prevalence of long-term disabilities among European men aged 80+ years is 58.8% among the lower educated versus 40.2% among the higher educated.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts

Within countries, the evidence shows that in general the lower an individual’s socioeconomic position the worse their health. There is a social gradient in health that runs from top to bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. This is a global phenomenon, seen in low, middle and high income countries. The social gradient in health means that health inequities affect everyone.For example, if you look at under-5 mortality rates by levels of household wealth you see that within counties the relation between socioeconomic level and health is graded. The poorest have the highest under-5 mortality rates, and people in the second highest quintile of household wealth have higher mortality in their offspring than those in the highest quintile.

4cd33d15-2ae5-432c-9e19-09ce6950bcc2,What are the drivers of health inequities?,"The global context affects how societies prosper through its impact on international relations and domestic norms and policies. These in turn shape the way society, both at national and local level, organizes its affairs, giving rise to forms of social position and hierarchy, whereby populations are organized according to income, education, occupation, gender, race/ethnicity and other factors. Where people are in the social hierarchy affects the conditions in which they grow, learn, live, work and age, their vulnerability to ill health and the consequences of ill health.The benefits of the economic growth that has taken place over the last 25 years are unequally distributed. In 1980 the richest countries, containing 10% of the world’s population, had gross national income 60 times that of the poorest countries, containing 10% of the world’s population. By 2005 this ratio had increased to 122.International flows of aid – grossly inadequate in themselves, and well below the levels promised – are dwarfed by the scale of many poor countries’ debt repayment obligations. The result is that, in many cases, there is a net financial outflow from poorer to richer countries – an alarming state of affairs.The trend over the last 15 years has been for the poorest quintile of the population in many countries to have a declining share in national consumption. In Kenya, for example, at current economic growth rates and with the present levels of income inequality, the median family in poverty would not cross the poverty line until 2030. Doubling the share of income growth enjoyed by Kenya’s poor would mean that reduction in poverty would happen by 2013.Gender biases in power, resources, entitlements, norms and values, and the way in which organizations are structured and programmes are run damage the health of millions of girls and women. The position of women in society is also associated with child health and survival – of boys and girls.Health equity depends vitally on the empowerment of individuals to challenge and change the unfair and steeply graded distribution of social resources to which everyone has equal claims and rights. Inequity in power interacts across four main dimensions – political, economic, social, and cultural – together constituting a continuum along which groups are, to varying degrees, excluded or included.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts

While health may not be the main aim of policies in these sectors, they have strong bearing on health and health equity.Policy coherence is crucial – different government departments’ policies must complement rather than contradict each other in relation to health equity. For example, trade policy that actively encourages the production, trade, and consumption of foods high in fats and sugars to the detriment of fruit and vegetable production is contradictory to health policyObesity is becoming a real public health challenge in transitioning countries, as it already is in high-income nations. Obesity prevention requires approaches that ensure a sustainable, adequate, and nutritious food supply; a habitat that lends itself to easy uptake of healthier food; participation in physical activity; and a family, educational, and work environment that positively reinforces healthy living. Very little of this action sits within the capabilities or responsibilities of the health sector. Positive advances have been made – for example, bans on advertisements for foods high in fats, sugars, and salt during television programmes aimed at children. However, a significant challenge remains: to engage with the multiple sectors outside health in areas such as trade, agriculture, employment, and education, if we are to redress the global obesity epidemic.Equity monitor",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts

of the world's adult population is overweight and almost one in 10 is
obese. Additionally there are over 40 million children under age five
who are overweight.
Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health.
Carrying extra fat leads to serious health consequences such as
cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2
diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some
cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause
premature death and substantial disability. What is not widely known is that the risk of health problems
starts when someone is only very slightly overweight, and that the
likelihood of problems increases as someone becomes more and more
overweight. Many of these conditions cause long-term suffering for
individuals and families. In addition, the costs for the health care
system can be extremely high. The good news is that overweight and obesity are largely
preventable. The key to success is to achieve an energy balance between
calories consumed on one hand, and calories used on the other hand. To reach this goal, people can limit energy intake from total
fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated
fats; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes,
whole grains and nuts; and limit their intake of sugars. And to increase
calories used, people can boost their levels of physical activity -
to at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most
days. Related linksDiet and physical activity: a public health priority",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/obesity-health-consequences-of-being-overweight

The user can choose to plan for intervention target setting by vertical programme or by service delivery level.
In both cases there is a process for detailed planning and for indicating which interventions should be
delivered at which delivery level, and with which resources.
Should the user choose to configure planning parameters by vertical programme, the tool is opened with
default assumptions available for 8 programmes that aim to capture interventions related to health MDGs:
Child health; Reproductive and maternal health; Immunization; Nutrition; Water and Sanitation (WASH); HIV;
TB; and Malaria. Additional programme components with default values will be added in 2013, including
NCDs and mental health.
The tool is flexible allowing the user to shift interventions between programmes, and also merge and/or
create new programmes as needed depending on the national planning context.
The following modules are included for health systems planning
Human resources
Infrastructure
Logistics

7ecbee8e-00a1-4163-a3ae-8a9ae8077287,What formula algorithms are used?,"The tool uses an ingredients approach which multiplies Quantities by Prices. Prices and quantities are
sometimes aggregated and presented to the user as unit costs. The tool allows for changes in quantities
and prices over time (by year). The following algorithms are used in the tool for intervention costing:
• Population in need of intervention = Population (demographic projection) x Proportion (%) of
population identified as in need of the intervention (based on prevalence, incidence, or preventive
properties of the intervention)
• Population receiving the intervention = Population in need of intervention x Coverage (%)
2
• Intervention cost = Population receiving the intervention x Units of resources needed per case* x
Price per unit
• Cost per delivery channel = Population receiving the intervention x Units needed per case* x Price
per unit x Delivery Channel (%)*It should be noted that the units of resources needed per intervention and per case treated are specific to
the delivery level. In contrast, the unit prices for inputs are stored centrally within databases. One central
database of commodities links to all modules in order to ensure that all references to the same commodity
will utilise the same price.
For health systems costing, similar algorithms are used. For example:
Number of nurses = Number of nurses in previous year + recruitment – attrition (1)
Salary cost for nurses per year = Number of nurses x average salary cost per year (2)
Some modules within the tool apply more advanced approaches to support decision making – for example,

interests of a user-friendly interface, formulas themselves are not visible in the software. The user can
review the formulas through information available in the accompanying technical documentation and
programming source code is available upon request.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool
87b28975-5b0d-48e9-9833-0b9844d742b4,How is an increase in intervention coverage handled throughout the tool?,"Any planned increase in intervention coverage is communicated throughout the tool to all relevant modules.
At the level of intervention costing, any increase in population coverage is translated into a greater number
of recipients of the intervention, and thus into greater quantities of drugs and commodities required, which is
adjusted in the total budget for commodities within the plan.
Furthermore there are direct links to the health system investment modules. For example the increase in
commodities is translated into specific requirements for the supply chain where the user can model logistics
activities to ensure that commodities are transported to where they are needed, thus impacting costs for
logistics. As another example there is a link built in whereby population coverage is translated into the
estimated required number of health care visits at all levels, which is then further translated into an
estimated number of full time equivalent health care workers that would be required to provide the care,
given the skills specification and time required indicated per service provided. This estimate can be used as
a check within the human resources planning module, to compare the predicted output of health workers
estimated needed, based on a bottom-up approach.

intervention coverage or through a menu of options.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool

and hospital level. The cost for providing the same service at different levels will be different, given costs for
infrastructure, human resources, equipment, etc. associated with each level. Moreover, the tool includes a
function whereby the user can specify the commodities and human resource inputs needed for each
3
intervention, by delivery level. As an example, costs for maternal health services at hospital level may be
relatively high and the tool can be used to model different scenarios for shifting maternal health services to
lower levels, thus informing policy discussions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool
b5364982-a623-440d-8684-01f206b0bcd2,To what extent does the tool take into account economies (or diseconomies) of scale?,"Economies of scale refer to decreases in average unit costs as the number of outputs increases. This
phenomenon applies within the health sector where large fixed costs are spread across the number of
patients using health services and higher coverage rates would spread costs over a greater number of
people. There may also be increasing average costs as coverage is extended to populations that are hard to
reach, and where a higher per-patient investment in both fixed and variable costs may be needed in order to
ensure universal coverage of health care.
OneHealth takes into account economies and diseconomies of scale implicitly, since quantities of inputs are
defined relative to the population covered. The user can enter assumptions for the programme activities
needed to extend services to hard-to-reach populations, including information campaigns, delivery of
services via outreach, and financial incentives to generate demand or encourage staff to work among
marginalized populations. In essence, OneHealth allows average costs to vary with scale, thus there may
be implicit economies of scale as output is increased. However the average cost (fixed and variable) would
not be a user input into the tool, rather it could be an output of the tool (for example the average
infrastructure cost per average outpatient visit).The tool does not output the average cost per person
reached, but a user could calculate this based on total costs and the number of persons reached by
intervention, if useful.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool
5b2dc5d5-5167-4557-aa09-940d936a6bbd,To what extent does the tool deal with shared costs and potential double counting?,"Resources and costs are estimated at the input level to minimize double counting. Shared resources for
health systems are estimated within the health systems modules and not in the programme-specific
modules, to ensure that resources are planned for by each cost centre. For example in the tool, facilities,
logistics, governance and human resources are systems costs only represented once, in the health systems
modules. Numerous links are built into the tool to enable the user to ensure that double counting is
minimised. For example, the list of surveys planned for M&E by each health programme is summarised and
communicated to the module for Health Information Systems (HIS) where they can be reviewed and
discussed to inform the HIS plan. Mechanisms within the tool also exist for analysing activities that could be
considered cross-cutting and for which integration could be strengthened, such as training programmes that

inputs. This is in line with global efforts to help countries develop comprehensive M&E systems that
generate data which can be linked to results and from the foundation of evidence-based planning and
budgeting. The approach used in OneHealth is ingredients based costing by which the user enters
information on quantities and prices, rather than unit costs.Information on quantities and prices is often
more readily available at the country level than unit costs.
Where appropriate, OneHealth is also equipped with default values for both quantities and prices, with the
former are based on technical programme standards for service provision and health system strengthening.
Price defaults are made available from UN statistical databases, to the extent possible as country-specific

A newly developed tuberculosis (TB) model projects impact on TB health targets.
Additional work is planned in the future to support further development of impact models where feasible, for
example for Non-Communicable diseases and Malaria in adults.
Health outcome is measured as the number of health problems averted or a reduction in morbidity. For
example, the number of pneumonia deaths averted in children under-5 years is the number of deaths in the

control programmes to match the country context, and then estimate the cost for a specific programme,
including an analysis of broader health system implications. The format for programme planning is
streamlined such that a consistent approach is used across programmes. It is however encouraged that a
programme plan looks at the broader health system constraints that may affect the delivery of the key

monitoring and supervision, programme-specific in-service training courses to build skills of health workers,
programme planning and updating of guidelines. Many of these activities can be considered relatively
standardized, for example the type of equipment required to deliver TB services, and the recommended
training courses to ensure that health workers have the skills necessary to deliver high quality interventions.
In order to simplify data entry, OneHealth includes default information on programmatic activities where
these are standardized. This includes, where available, details on specific in-service training courses, and
standard surveys that may be implemented for M&E of each programme. The intention is to provide default
information, in order to reduce the data entry load on the user and to provide a check list of activities. The
default assumptions for programme activities are based on expert opinion of the appropriate technical
departments as to what kind of activities would need to be planned for within a national programme planning
framework. It should be noted that the user must actively choose each activity and set a specific target in
order for that activity to be included in the plan with an associated cost. The user guide makes it clear that
these are to be treated as suggested activities for consideration, and not an absolute requirement for
scaling-up.
The advantage of using defaults is that users can apply defaults, reviewing and changing values as needed.
It also helps to facilitate understanding of how the tool works, and what kind of data should be entered into
each section. The disadvantage is that users may be encouraged to select as many of the default activities
as possible without considering true programme needs.

health systems modules for Human Resources for Health ( HRH) and Infrastructure are filled in first, to
provide a basis for projecting the health system's capacity to deliver services over the coming years. Next,
the service and intervention planning can be done (by disease-specific programme or by health service
levels). The scale-up of interventions will affect the Logistics and Supply chain planning for medicines and
commodities. Planning will be iterative, and several cycles of adjustments are likely needed.
Financial space may be estimated prior to costing or following the first round of costing and then compared
with the cost estimates produced with the tool. In the process of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) , the financial ceiling may have already been set and planning within each module (health systems,
services) should then be done within the anticipated resource envelope.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool

includes an examination of the strengths and weaknesses of generic attributes that are considered to be the
foundation of a 'good' national strategy.2
OneHealth primarily responds to the first key attribute of the JANS
criteria, namely to ensure that the strategies outlined within the plan are based on a rigorous situation
analysis. Moreover the software facilitates an assessment of priority health needs where planning is driven
by explicit analysis of the current health system and what can realistically be achieved in the medium term.
OneHealth facilitates a comprehensive budget/costing of the program areas covered by the national

92585070-4efb-4241-9227-3346f762f21d,How can OneHealth support an MTEF or a SWAp?,"A Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is a multi-year public expenditure planning exercise that is
used to set out future budget requirements for planned services and strategic activities, and to analyse
these within the likely resource envelope available according to the finance department expenditure ceilings.
While the MTEF is often multi-sectoral, there is also a need to plan within the resource envelope specific to
health. A sector-wide approach (SWAp) is a process whereby all significant government and donor funding
for the sector is aligned to support a single sector policy and expenditure programme.
OneHealth can support MTEF and SWAp processes through facilitating the alignment with desired
characteristics such as:
- Costs estimated based on a bottom-up, evidence based approach- Revenue flows, including aid flows, estimated over time based on realistic targets.
- Future implications of policy decisions are modeled and their affordability considered
- The basis for MTEF costs and revenue projections is transparent, thus line departments need to
plan activities explicitly and their implementation can also be monitored over time.
- The national health strategy is evidence based and inputs can be compared with costs, outputs
and health outcomes facilitating a priority setting process. This should facilitate buy-in from external
donors.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool
72cbc8d7-362f-4511-b7e6-548f5c6623cb,How does the tool support informed priority setting?,"The tool enables priority setting in several ways.
First, the tool includes a function for performing bottleneck analysis. The function of the bottleneck analysis
is to identify strategies that would facilitate scaling up the interventions. This is done by using indicators to
indicate system and programme performance for different levels of access. The approach is done using six
coverage indicators:
– availability of essential commodities,
– availability of human resources,
– physical accessibility,
– initial utilization,
– timely continuous utilization, and
– effective quality coverage of services.
Note that it is the last level - the effective quality coverage of services - that can be directly linked to the final
coverage, and thus the health impact modeling.
Second, costs are compared with the financial resources available, which compel the users to consider their
financial limitations and plan realistically. Third, the tool is designed to illustrate health system implications of
scaling up intervention delivery, and to show the capital investment gap. The fact that the tool highlights to
the user where intervention scale-up would be difficult given a weak health system helps place emphasis on
the need to strengthen systems for sustainable long term planning, informing choices. Fourth, policy levers
within modules can be adjusted and the user can observe the effects on targets (both system and health
impact targets). Fifth, multiple projections can be launched and viewed side by side, varying certain
parameters and observing how costs and outputs change.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool

18ebe321-5224-40c0-b8a9-86b60e17618c,Why is smoking an issue for non-smokers?,"There are some 4000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke; at least
250 of them are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause
cancer in humans. Tobacco smoke in enclosed spaces is breathed in by
everyone, exposing smokers and nonsmokers alike to its harmful effects.
Around 700 million children, or almost half of the world's
total, breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Over 40% of children have
at least one smoking parent. In 2004, children accounted for 31% of the
600 000 premature deaths attributable to second-hand smoke.In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and
respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer.
In infants, it causes sudden death syndrome. In pregnant women, it
causes low birth weight.
Neither ventilation nor filtration, even in combination, can
reduce tobacco smoke exposure indoors to levels that are considered
acceptable. Only 100% smoke-free environments provide effective
protection. Contrary to common belief, smoke-free environments are
widely supported by both smokers and nonsmokers. Having a smoke-free environment often saves money for bars and
restaurant owners, reducing their risks of fire and consequently their
insurance costs. It often results in lower renovation, cleaning and
maintenance costs, too.
Article 8 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,
recognizes that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and
disability, and asks countries to adopt and implement legislation that
provides protection from second-hand smoke.
Many countries around the world have already introduced laws
to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places.
Celebrations around the globe on World No Tobacco Day (31 May) encourage
more people and more countries to go smoke-free.Join the trend by claiming your right to public places that are 100% smoke-free inside.Related linksTobacco Free Initiative (TFI)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/why-is-smoking-an-issue-for-non-smokers

The concerns that were raised in 1999 in the USA regarding exposure to mercury following immunization with thiomersal-containing vaccines were based on the calculation that the cumulative amount of mercury in infant immunization schedules potentially exceeded the recommended threshold for methyl mercury set by a U.S. government agency. At the time the concerns were raised, there was scientific uncertainty over the issue and the regulator (the United States Food and Drug Administration), taking a precautionary approach, requested manufacturers to consider development of thiomersal-free products for routine immunization. However, thiomersal contains ethyl mercury, not methyl mercury, and ethyl and methyl mercury are quite different.

f14c7b66-a783-4ac8-86ee-b3bcd630de85,Can you provide more information on the studies reviewed by the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety ?,"Since August 2000, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), responsible for advising WHO on vaccine safety issues of potential global importance, has periodically reviewed available information on thiomersal pharmacokinetic studies in humans (including low birth-weight infants) and in monkeys and has assessed the validity of animal models in studying associations between thiomersal and neuro-developmental disorders (such as autism) in humans.
Expert consultation and data presented to GACVS indicate that the pharmacokinetic profile of ethyl mercury is substantially different to that of methyl mercury. In particular, the half-life of ethyl mercury is short (6 days; 95% CI: 3-10 days) compared with 40-50 days for methyl mercury, making exposure to ethyl mercury in blood comparatively brief and preventing accumulation when vaccines are administered at least four weeks apart. Further, ethyl mercury is actively excreted via the gut, unlike methyl mercury, which accumulates in the body. This rapid elimination of ethyl mercury has been confirmed in all studies reviewed, even those that looked at low birth-weight infants.
Four independent epidemiological studies investigating associations and frequency of neuro-developmental disorders in relation to vaccination with thiomersal-containing vaccines from the United Kingdom and Denmark did not challenge the safety of existing thiomersal-containing vaccines in infants.
GACVS also reviewed a series of studies by Geier and Geier alleging reduction of neuro-developmental disorders in the USA following discontinuation of thiomersal-containing vaccines in the national immunization programme. The Committee found a number of methodological limitations, such that published outcomes regarding neurodevelopment and heart disease following administration of thiomersal-containing vaccines do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest a causal relationship. The Committee therefore found the conclusions made by these authors both unconvincing and unsubstantiated.
On that basis the GACVS considers that pharmacokinetic and developmental studies undertaken do not support concerns over the safety of thiomersal in vaccines.
The Committee has concluded that there is no reason on grounds of safety to change current immunization practices with thiomersal-containing vaccines, as the alleged risks are unproven.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mercury-health

It is estimated that use of thiomersal-containing vaccines to protect against these diseases averted at least 1 400 000 child deaths in 2010. Thiomersal-containing vaccines are being used in over 120 countries. Removing thiomersal completely from vaccines would require either using alternative preservatives or using preservative-free single-dose vaccines exclusively. Alternative presentations (with other preservatives, or preservative-free) would incur significant costs for development and regulatory approval, thereby limiting the ability to offer affordable vaccines.
Use of multi-dose vials is the most efficient and cost-effective presentation for protection of populations in instances when vaccines need to be administered to large numbers of people in a short space of time, such as in epidemic or pandemic situations.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mercury-health

A few studies have been done to compare the effectiveness of the different preservatives but the data is limited and inconclusive. Extrapolation from a few examples that an alternative preservative can be used for all vaccines is speculation. Practically, any vaccine presentation for which another preservative is to be used for the first time will require new clinical evaluation to test for safety and efficacy.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mercury-health

Vaccine manufacturers have conducted research into alternative preservatives but, except for research on inactivated polio vaccine and a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, there has been a conspicuous lack of success.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mercury-health
1da67aab-c42e-425e-86e0-0e4116b082f2,Could supplying vaccines in single-dose vials only be an option ?,"Vaccines could be supplied in preservative-free single-dose vials as is the case for the majority of vaccines used in industrialized countries. However, this option requires a significant increase in manufacturers' filling capacity. This would be time consuming and expensive to implement and it may not be possible to produce sufficient single-dose product to ensure uninterrupted global supply.
There is also the vaccine cost element: vaccines supplied in single-dose vials are more expensive than a dose of vaccine from a multi-dose vial.
In addition, single-dose vials require significantly larger cold storage space as well as increased transport capacity, which is currently not feasible for the majority of countries. Current WHO estimates suggest that the vaccine storage requirements would at least double if only single-dose presentations were used (WHO vaccine volume calculator, March 2011). Upgrading the cold chains of those countries is limited by local resources and the additional maintenance requirements that would render many existing systems vulnerable.
Replacing thiomersal in vaccines would require regulatory approval. There is no guarantee of obtaining a vaccine of equivalent quality, safety and efficacy following replacement of thiomersal as an inactivating agent or replacement or removal of thiomersal as the preservative from an existing licensed product. This would require a new licensing application, including conducting of new manufacturing validation studies; and pre-clinical and clinical studies.

The reasons for this position are as follows:

regular review by WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety of new studies relating to the safety of thiomersal in vaccines over more than a decade has not provided any evidence to suggest a possible health hazard with the amounts of thiomersal currently used in vaccines; and
the use of multi-dose vials remains the best option for routine immunization programmes in many countries because they are safe and effective, they limit the required storage capacity and waste, and help reduce vaccine costs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mercury-health

will more than triple from 600 million to 2 billion. Most of this
increase is occurring in less developed countries - where the number of
older people will rise from 400 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion by 2050.
This demographic change has several implications for public
health. Good health is key if older people are to remain independent
and to play a part in family and community life. Life-long health
promotion and disease prevention activities can prevent or delay the
onset of noncommunicable and chronic diseases, such as heart disease,
stroke and cancer.
But these diseases also need to be detected and treated early
to minimize their consequences, and those who have an advanced disease
will need decent long term care and support. These services are best
delivered through comprehensive primary care.Public health action can also draw on the capacities of older
people. For example, the world's growing population of older people
plays a critical role through volunteering, transmitting experience and

The Government of Japan’s early actions in response to events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were in line with the existing recommendations for radiation exposure. The Government has evacuated individuals who were living within a 20-kilometre radius around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Those living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant were asked to evacuate voluntarily. In general, people living farther away of the site of the event are at lower risk than those who live nearby.
In light of evolving new information on levels of environmental radioactivity in the 20-30 km zone and some surrounding areas beyond the 30km zone, the Government of Japan established new planned evacuation zones from which residents were relocated to temporary housing based on the estimated cumulative doses they may receive in the 1 year following the accident.
In addition, an emergency evacuation preparedness zone was also identified in which residents were asked to prepare their affairs in case they were asked to evacuate.

During the early phase of the emergency, travellers were advised to avoid travel to the areas most affected by the earthquake and tsunami because of disruptions to essential services, such as transport and electric power. The ongoing disaster relief activities, including the nuclear power plant emergency response and control activities, would have made travel difficult and could have consumed resources needed by relief workers and residents. Moreover, as indicated by the Japanese authorities, travel within the evacuation and exclusion zones surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was prohibited.
In general, travellers who do not have essential reasons to travel were advised to give careful consideration to deferring travel to any areas where there had been considerable disruption to the normal infrastructure and where authorities were responding to urgent humanitarian needs.
The situation in Japan has improved. Residents are being temporary allowed access into some areas that had been evacuated, but restrictions still exist. The Government of Japan is monitoring the situation and plans to lift restrictions once safety conditions are met.
Information on the status of the nuclear facilities in Fukushima can be found on Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) website and on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.
Travellers should be aware of the risk of further earthquakes across Japan. Moreover, there may be areas of power, fuel, food and water shortages.

88fa29ec-ed71-4b12-acfd-5b3c9098612d,What emotional impact can a nuclear accident have on children? How can they be assisted?,"Disasters and their aftermath can have a profound emotional impact on children and may result in long term behavioural disturbances. Children exhibiting signs of stress - including difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, developing new fears, changes in behaviour (e.g. clinging, bedwetting), being preoccupied with the crisis - should receive extra time and attention from family members and other caregivers.
Children are among the most vulnerable of those affected by a nuclear accident because of their inability to fully understand and process the immediate and long-term effects of the emergency. Family members and caregivers should try to find out what the child thinks and feels about the disaster. If the child is scared because she/he has misunderstood what has happened, then simple explanations should be provided while avoiding alarming details. Children need a chance to play and relax. Encourage older children to be helpful and maintain regular routines.
Reactions to stress can depend on developmental level and are generally marked by changes in typical behaviour for a specific child or adolescent. Reactions may continue for days, weeks or even months. Children should see a paediatrician or mental health professional if anxiety or grief interferes with their daily functioning, or if these emotions do not reduce with time. Early management of these symptoms can speed recovery and prevent long-term consequences.

Those closest to the radiation source are at greatest risk of exposure and the greater the distance away, the lower the risk.
In the early phase of a nuclear emergency (within the first hours/days), urgent protective actions may be implemented to prevent radiation exposure, taking into account projected doses that people may received in the short-term (e.g. within 2-7 days). These necessary actions depend on the estimated exposure (i.e., the amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere and the prevailing meteorological conditions, such as wind and rain. Actions may include: evacuation of the area around or near the nuclear power plant; advising people to shelter in their homes, offices, other secure buildings or designated shelters to reduce exposure; and distributing and administering potassium iodide pills to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer).
When environmental and human monitoring data increases, relocation of people to temporary housing may be considered in particular areas, taking into account the radiation doses that residents may receive over the long-term (e.g. one year).
If warranted, public health or national authorities may restrict or prohibit the consumption of vegetables and dairy products produced in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant in order to reduce exposure. Monitoring programs are established to inform longer term decisions on food restriction, water consumption, and the control of internationally traded foodstuffs.

The exact effect will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount. According to data reported so far, radioactive iodine and caesium are the main contaminants, and concentrations in some food samples have been detected at levels above the Japanese regulatory limits.
Radioactive iodine has a half-life of eight days and decays naturally within weeks. If ingested, it can accumulate in the body, particularly the thyroid gland, and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children.
The ingestion of potassium iodide is an established method to prevent the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid.
Radioactive caesium has a half-life longer than that of radioactive iodine (up to 30 years) and can stay in the environment for many years.

In these circumstances, radioactive material falling from the air or carried in rain water or snow, can deposit on the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed. Also, over time, radioactivity can build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals. Radioactivity can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take up the radionuclides.

These GLs are published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.The GLs state that, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding Guideline Level, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption. When the Guideline Levels are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the Guideline Levels may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small addition to the total dose, the Guideline Levels may be increased by a factor of 10”.GLs for radionuclide levels can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995)Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed(CODEX STAN 193-1995)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns

In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the contamination of food by radiological materials. For example, it is possible to do the following:protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins;close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables;bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn;harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; anddon’t harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded.Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as:avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables;avoid slaughtering animals;avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); andavoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.Additional information on emergency preparedness and responseJoint FAO/IAEA Programme",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns

In the case of radioactive iodine the standard for adults is 300 Becquerels per litre in drinking-water. In the very unlikely scenario that drinking-water was contaminated and consumed for an entire year at this level, the additional radiation exposure from this water would be equivalent to natural background radiation during one year.During the early phase of the emergency WHO urged people in the area to heed the advice of local authorities, as they have access to the latest measurements of radiation levels in water to compare against the standards for adults and children.

development of infants. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the
first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and
health. After six months, they should be fed adequate and safe
complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years
or beyond.
Complementary foods should be rich in nutrients and given in
adequate amounts. At six months, caregivers should introduce foods in
small amounts and gradually increase the quantity as the child gets
older. Young children should receive a variety of foods including meat,
poultry, fish or eggs as often as possible. Infants can eat pureed,
mashed and semi-solid foods beginning at 6 months, from 8 months, most
infants can eat 'finger' foods, and from 12 months, most children can
eat the same types of foods as consumed by the rest of the family. The
consistency of foods should be appropriate for the child's age.
Complementary foods should be given 2–3 times a day between 6–8 months,
increasing to 3–4 times a day between 9–11 months. Between 12–23 months
of age, 3–4 meals should be given. Also, depending on the child's
appetite, 1–2 nutritious snacks can be offered between meals. In addition to providing an adequate variety, amount and
frequency of foods, it is important that caregivers practice responsive
feeding. That is, they should feed infants directly and assist older
children when they feed themselves; feed slowly and patiently and
encourage children to eat, but not force them; and when children refuse
to eat, experiment with different combinations of foods. Feeding times
are periods of learning and love - they are a time for caregivers to

status, growth and health of infants and children. It is based both on
the evidence that nutrition plays a crucial role in the early months and
years of life, and on the importance of appropriate feeding practices

six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be
adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and
micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional
needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to
minimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires
active care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.The
transition from exclusive breastfeeding to full use of family foods is a
very vulnerable period. It is the time when many infants become
malnourished, contributing significantly to the high prevalence of
malnutrition in children under five years of

through the air and by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. Iodine becomes
localized in the thyroid gland. Because many infants and children consume relatively large quantities of
milk and dairy products, and because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their
metabolism, exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults.Caesium isotopes have longer half-lives (caesium-134 and caesium-137 have half-lives of 2 years and
30 years, respectively). There are thus longer-term exposures to these radionuclides through the

decades after the accident); and among residents of other European countries, less than 1 mSv (in the
first year after the accident).

doses are below the global average annual dose of 2.4 mSv from natural background radiation, the

d2aa586d-8a03-4f21-b25c-a64e6ee3b6c5,What were the impacts on health from Chernobyl?,"In 2006, WHO published its report summarizing the data from two decades of research on the health
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. It included reviews of studies carried out on cancers, noncancer diseases, immune and genetic effects, and reproductive and children’s health, as well as
evidence-based recommendations for national health authorities and for further research.In 2011, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)
published a report entitled ""Health effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident."" The findings
were based on more than two decades of experimental and analytical studies of the health
consequences of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. The report is the most comprehensive
evaluation to date of exposure levels and health effects from the Chernobyl accident.Radiation sicknessAccording to the UNSCEAR report, the Chernobyl accident caused a number of severe radiation
effects almost immediately. Of 600 workers present on the site during the early morning of 26 April
1986, 134 received very high doses (0.8-16 Grey) and suffered from acute radiation sickness. Of those,
28 workers died in the first three months.Radiation-induced cataractsAmong those who survived radiation sickness, recovery took several years. Many of them developed
radiation-induced cataracts in the first few years after the accident. Recent studies of the recovery
operation workers indicate that opacities of the eye lens might result from radiation doses lower than
previously expected (about 500 mSv).CancersFor the last two decades, attention has been focused on investigating the association between exposure
to radionuclides released in the Chernobyl accident and late effects, in particular thyroid cancer. In the
first few months after the accident, radiation dose exposures to the thyroid received were particularly
high in children and adolescents living in Belarus, Ukraine and the most affected regions of the Russian
Federation, and in those who drank milk with high levels of radioactive iodine. By 2005, more than
6,000 thyroid cancer cases had been diagnosed in this group. It is most likely that a large fraction of
these thyroid cancers are attributable to radioiodine intake. Furthermore, it is expected that increases in
thyroid cancer incidence due to the Chernobyl accident will continue for many more years, although
long-term increases are difficult to quantify.Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed at a young age,
there is some indication of increased leukaemia and cataract incidence among workers. Otherwise,
there is no clearly demonstrated increase in the incidence of solid cancers or leukaemia due to radiation
in the exposed populations. There also is no convincing proof so far of increases in other nonmalignant disorders that are related to ionizing radiation.Among 530,000 registered recovery operation workers who worked between 1986 and 1990, the
average dose was 120 mSv (ranging from 20 to 500 mSv). That cohort is still potentially at risk of
cancer and other diseases and their health continues to be closely followed.Among Russian recovery operation workers with higher average doses (above 200 mSv), evidence is
emerging of some increase in the incidence of leukaemia. Based on other studies, the annual incidence
of radiation-induced leukaemia would be expected to fall within a few decades after exposure.There is a tendency to attribute increases in rates of all cancers over time to the Chernobyl accident, but
it should be noted that increases in cancer in the affected areas were also observed before the accident.
Moreover, a general increase in mortality has been reported in recent decades in most areas of the
former Soviet Union, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the results of the accident-related studies.Persistent psychological or mental health problemsSeveral international studies have reported that exposed populations, compared to controls, had anxiety
symptom levels that were twice as high and were more likely to report multiple unexplained physical
symptoms and subjective poor health. Given that rates of mental health problems increase after a
disaster and may manifest years after the event, WHO recommends improving availability and access
to normal community mental health services in disaster-affected areas.One of the objectives of the on-going UN inter-agency International Chernobyl Research and
Information Network (ICRIN) project is to alleviate the stigma of psychological trauma in
society, encourage self-reliance, and empower local communities to take control over their own lives.
One of the ways to achieve these goals is to promote healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and
healthy diet, and to explain the environmental, behavioural, and other risks for various chronic diseases,
including cancer. Concerns related to fertility and birth defectsIn the Chernobyl-affected regions, there is no evidence of decreased fertility among males or females in
the general population. However, birth rates may be lower in contaminated areas because of a high rate
of medical abortions.Since 1986, there has been a reported increase in congenital malformations in both contaminated and
uncontaminated areas of Belarus which predated Chernobyl and may be the result of increased
registration of such cases. Based on dose levels to which the majority of the population was exposed,
there is unlikely to be a major effect on the number of stillbirths, adverse pregnancy outcomes, delivery
complications, or the overall health of children, but monitoring remains important.Potential impact on health in other European countriesSo far, there has been no clear evidence of any measurable increases in adverse health effects related to
the Chernobyl radiation in countries outside of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident

shared the set criteria. The report was finalized at the end 2005 and published in spring 2006.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an international cancer research
institution established by WHO, published estimated projections of 25,000 potential excess cancers for
Europe (Cardis et al. 2006) through 2065 that might be attributable to exposure to radiation from
Chernobyl of which 16,000 cases could be fatal.
2007-2008 Following the UN inter-agency Chernobyl Forum in 2006, the UN launched its Action Plan
for the third decade of Chernobyl until 2016. As part of the UN family, WHO has a mandate to
implement this Action Plan according to UN General Assembly resolutions. 2007-2008Following the UN inter-agency Chernobyl Forum in 2006, the UN launched its Action Plan
for the third decade of Chernobyl until 2016. As part of the UN family, WHO has a mandate to
implement this Action Plan according to UN General Assembly resolutions.2009-2011The International Chernobyl Research and Information Network (ICRIN) was launched by
four United Nations agencies, as a part of the UN Action Plan implementation programme, to meet the
information needs of affected communities in Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This threeyear initiative is part of a larger effort to help local communities “return to normal” in the course of the
decade that ends in 2016 and aims to translate the latest scientific information on the consequences of
the accident into sound practical advice for residents of the affected territories. Activities planned under
the ICRIN project include the dissemination of information, through education and training for teachers,
medical professionals, community leaders, and the media; providing local residents with practical
advice on health risks and healthy lifestyles; the creation of internet-equipped information centers in
rural areas; and small-scale community infrastructure projects aimed at improving living conditions and
promoting self-reliance. 2010IARC completed an EC-funded project on the development of a strategic research agenda (SRA)
for Chernobyl studies (8), where a group of experts and advisors supports proposals for the long-term
funding of a Chernobyl Health Effects Research Foundation (similar to the action taken to create the
Radiation Effects Research Foundation some years after the atomic bomb exposures in Japan) together
with a series of individual studies covering the main health consequences. These include a focus on
thyroid cancer, breast cancer, inherited molecular-genetic alterations, various other cancers, cataracts,
and other non-cancer diseases in nuclear plant workers and in the general, exposed population. 2011An UNSCEAR report (9)  on Chernobyl recognized that while new research data has become
available, major conclusions regarding the scale and nature of the health consequences of the 1986
Chernobyl accident were ""essentially consistent with previous assessments"".UNSCEAR reported more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer, of which 15 have been fatal, among
people who were children or adolescents in Belarus, the four most affected regions in the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. A substantial proportion of cases were associated with radiation exposure.
The report also reconfirmed that radiation doses to the public from the 1986 accident were relatively
low and most residents ""need not live in fear of serious health consequences"".OngoingSince the start of the ICRIN project in 2009, WHO has developed information materials and
carried out trainings and workshops targeting primary health care workers, teachers, and mass-media
workers of the most affected regions of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. An ICRIN side
event co-sponsored by WHO was featured in conjunction with the international conference held in
Kiev, Ukraine on 20-21 April 2011. Four WHO Collaborating Centres in the Russia Federation and
Ukraine are leading the health research project on Chernobyl-affected populations.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident
b0ebb8f3-f119-411d-8ee5-73dde9e53c2e,What is WHO's relationship with the IAEA?,"WHO and the IAEA are both UN entities. WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health
within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters,
shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy
options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends.The IAEA is the UN system agency which works with its Member States and multiple partners
worldwide to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies.
WHO collaborates with the IAEA on a number of areas including the medical use of radiation,
radiation protection and the safety of the public and workers, and radio-nuclear emergency
preparedness and response.Under the auspices of the UN Chernobyl Forum, WHO carried out its own independent health
assessment of the accident. The IAEA assessed the environmental impact and UNDP the socioeconomic impact.A digest document including summaries of the three reports (WHO Health report, IAEA environmental
report, and UNDP socio-economic impact report) entitled Chernobyl Legacy was then prepared jointly
by three agencies to present a comprehensive picture of the event, and was endorsed by all participants
of the Chernobyl Forum, including eight UN Agencies and the Governments of Belarus, the Russian
Federation, and Ukraine.Mention has often been made of WHO's 1959 agreement with the IAEA. This is a standard agreement
similar to agreements it has with other UN agencies as a means of setting out respective areas of work.
This agreement has never once been used to stop or restrict WHO’s work.The agreement serves the purpose of promoting co-operation and consultation between WHO and
IAEA. It was approved by the highest governing body of each Organization.The agreement between WHO and IAEA does not affect the impartial and independent exercise by
WHO of its statutory responsibilities, nor does it subordinate one Organization to the other. The clause appearing in Article III dealing with the safeguarding of confidential information is a
standard provision in many agreements of this kind (including WHO agreements with the UN, ILO,
FAO, UNESCO, and UNIDO). On the one hand, it ensures each Organization will continue to meet its obligations to protect certain information it is duty bound to safeguard. In the case of information held
by WHO, such a clause is relevant, for example, for the protection of clinical and other similar data on
individuals. On the other hand, the provision makes clear that subject to such situations, each
Organization ""shall keep [the] other fully informed [of] all … work"" of mutual interest. Thus, such
provisions actually work to improve information flow as they limit the exceptions to the free-flow of
information. WHO environmental health experts will continue the scientific collaboration with
radiation and health experts at IAEA. This entails not only nuclear safety issues and assistance in
radiation emergencies, but also the application of clinical techniques connected with such issues.WHO activities on nuclear matters are not in any way hampered by the WHO/IAEA agreement. Both
Organizations are working tirelessly to assist countries and the global community to deal with this
complex emergency.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident

crops, milk, food, and water; the effects of radiation exposure on different population groups; and the
kind of preventive measures that were to be put in place. In many countries, the accident prompted
important political discussions regarding the use of nuclear energy and national energy policies.Chernobyl underscored the critical need for international coordination and cooperation related to
environmental hazards. Chernobyl also prompted UN agencies to develop international agreements and
arrangements for nuclear emergencies. In 1986, two international conventions were adopted by the
IAEA’s General Conference: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the
Convention on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. WHO, which is
a party to both conventions, set up the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance
Network - WHO REMPAN - in 1987. Today, the network includes more than 40 centres world-wide

The Government has evacuated individuals who were living within a 20-kilometre radius around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Those living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant were asked to evacuate voluntarily. In general, people living farther away of the site of the event are at lower risk than those who live nearby.In light of evolving new information on levels of environmental radioactivity in the 20-30 km zone and some surrounding areas beyond the 30km zone, the Government of Japan established new planned evacuation zones from which residents were relocated to temporary housing based on the estimated cumulative doses they may receive in the 1 year following the accident.In addition, an emergency evacuation preparedness zone was also identified in which residents were asked to prepare their affairs in case they were asked to evacuate.

36b8f646-ff9b-4d7a-892f-84ea2d01e5b1,Are people normally exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Human beings are exposed to natural radiation (also known as background radiation) on a daily basis. Natural radiation comes from space (i.e. cosmic rays) as well as from naturally-occurring radioactive materials found in the soil, water and air. Radon gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is the main source of natural radiation.People can also be exposed to radiation from artificial sources. Today, the most common artificial sources of ionizing radiation are X-ray machines and other medical devices.Radiation doses can be expressed in Sievert (Sv) units. On average, a person is exposed to approximately 3.0 milli Sieverts (mSv)/year, of which 80% (2.4 mSv) is due to naturally-occurring sources (i.e., background radiation), 19.6 % (almost 0.6 mSv) is due to the medical use of radiation and the remaining 0.4% (around 0.01 mSv) is due to other sources of human-made radiation.In some parts of the world, levels of exposure to natural radiation differ due to local geology.

The ongoing disaster relief activities, including the nuclear power plant emergency response and control activities, would have made travel difficult and could have consumed resources needed by relief workers and residents. Moreover, as indicated by the Japanese authorities, travel within the evacuation and exclusion zones surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was prohibited.In general, travellers who do not have essential reasons to travel were advised to give careful consideration to deferring travel to any areas where there had been considerable disruption to the normal infrastructure and where authorities were responding to urgent humanitarian needs.The situation in Japan has improved. Residents are being temporary allowed access into some areas that had been evacuated, but restrictions still exist. The Government of Japan is monitoring the situation and plans to lift restrictions once safety conditions are met.Information on the status of the nuclear facilities in Fukushima can be found on Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) website and on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.Travellers should be aware of the risk of further earthquakes across Japan.

How can they be assisted?,"Disasters and their aftermath can have a profound emotional impact on children and may result in long term behavioural disturbances. Children exhibiting signs of stress - including difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, developing new fears, changes in behavior (e.g. clinging, bedwetting), being preoccupied with the crisis - should receive extra time and attention from family members and other caregivers.Children are among the most vulnerable of those affected by a nuclear accident because of their inability to fully understand and process the immediate and long-term effects of the emergency. Family members and caregivers should try to find out what the child thinks and feels about the disaster. If the child is scared because she/he has misunderstood what has happened, then simple explanations should be provided while avoiding alarming details. Children need a chance to play and relax. Encourage older children to be helpful and maintain regular routines.Reactions to stress can depend on developmental level and are generally marked by changes in typical behavior for a specific child or adolescent. Reactions may continue for days, weeks or even months. Children should see a paediatrician or mental health professional if anxiety or grief interferes with their daily functioning, or if these emotions do not reduce with time.

Those closest to the radiation source are at greatest risk of exposure and the greater the distance away, the lower the risk.In the early phase of a nuclear emergency (within the first hours/days), urgent protective actions may be implemented to prevent radiation exposure, taking into account projected doses that people may received in the short-term (e.g. within 2-7 days). These necessary actions depend on the estimated exposure (i.e., the amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere and the prevailing meteorological conditions, such as wind and rain. Actions may include: evacuation of the area around or near the nuclear power plant; advising people to shelter in their homes, offices, other secure buildings or designated shelters to reduce exposure; and distributing and administering potassium iodide pills to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer).When environmental and human monitoring data increases, relocation of people to temporary housing may be considered in particular areas, taking into account the radiation doses that residents may receive over the long-term (e.g. one year).If warranted, public health or national authorities may restrict or prohibit the consumption of vegetables and dairy products produced in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant in order to reduce exposure. Monitoring programs are established to inform longer term decisions on food restriction, water consumption, and the control of internationally traded foodstuffs.Only competent authorities who have conducted a careful analysis of the emergency situation are in a position to recommend which of these public health measures should be undertaken.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-fukushima-nuclear-concerns

c7444a71-f130-4371-bdcb-15043a2afaa8,What impact will this have on food and food production in Japan?,"The impact on food and food production in Japan will depend upon the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited or present where food is being produced or harvested. Although radioactive iodine in food is of immediate concern after nuclear emergencies, it has a relatively short half-life and will naturally decay over a short time frame. Radioactive caesium has also been detected in food. In contrast to radioactive iodine, radioactive caesium can linger in the environment for many years and could continue to present a longer term problem for food, and food production, and a threat to human health.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-fukushima-nuclear-concerns
6f981ead-880a-4a06-83a2-aa3ac35c1279,How do food products become radioactive?,"Foods can become contaminated with radioactive materials when they are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. In these circumstances, radioactive material falling from the air or carried in rain water or snow, can deposit on the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed. Also, over time, radioactivity can build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals. Radioactivity can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take up the radionuclides. The severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released.Radioactivity cannot contaminate food that is packaged; for example, tinned or plastic-wrapped food is protected from radioactivity as long as the food is sealed.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-fukushima-nuclear-concerns

However, contamination of food can occur through uptake from soil to crops, or to animals through feed, even when levels of radioactive contamination are lower than those which might pose a direct threat to human health. The standards for acceptable limits for radioactivity in food are set at low levels in order to take into account the possibility of contaminated food being eaten over an extended period of time and resulting in a cumulative dose.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-fukushima-nuclear-concerns
eb8a7ab9-dc73-45b0-9653-0fd77b947a16,Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for international trade?,"There are internationally agreed Codex Guideline Levels (GLs) for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. These GLs are published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.The GLs state that, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding Guideline Level, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption. When the Guideline Levels are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the Guideline Levels may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small addition to the total dose, the Guideline Levels may be increased by a factor of 10”.GLs for radionuclide levels can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995)Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed [pdf, 617KB](CODEX STAN 193-1995)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-fukushima-nuclear-concerns

In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the contamination of food by radiological materials. For example, it is possible to do the following:protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins;close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables;bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn;harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; anddon’t harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded.Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as:avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables;avoid slaughtering animals;avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); andavoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.Additional information on emergency preparedness and responseJoint FAO/IAEA Programme",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-fukushima-nuclear-concerns

Essential hydration of infants should not be compromised in an attempt to reduce exposure to radionuclide contamination.The standards adopted by the Japanese authorities for this emergency are precautionary. In the case of radioactive iodine the standard for adults is 300 Becquerels per litre in drinking-water. In the very unlikely scenario that drinking-water was contaminated and consumed for an entire year at this level, the additional radiation exposure from this water would be equivalent to natural background radiation during one year.During the early phase of the emergency WHO urged people in the area to heed the advice of local authorities, as they have access to the latest measurements of radiation levels in water to compare against the standards for adults and children.

fb2a644d-eae9-4bdb-96dd-a534babbd170,What are some of the steps in decision and policy-making?,"During the scoping stage of HIA, explore the policy’s context by answering the questions:
‘What is at stake (proposals, potential health impacts, other interests)‘.‘How does the policy come about (is there a consultation of stakeholders and citizens or is decision-making undertaken by one central actor) and how can HIA connect with this process’.‘Who are involved in the policy making process (decision-maker(s), stakeholders, researchers and other experts, citizens)’.‘What does the institutional context look like (formal decision-making procedures, communication rules, and informal relations between the several actors involved)’.This exploration can identify opportunities for the
HIA to link up with decision-makers and stakeholders who have similar interests. Also, the HIA has a better chance of anticipating difficulties in the process, and being able to develop strategies to address these difficulties.Produce an HIA that has a plan for active dissemination of HIA messages at key stages. Announcing the HIA (when it begins, and at other key steps, etc), disseminating preliminary findings, and using discussion groups will help to put health interests
on the agenda of agencies. These steps are equally as important as producing a sound report. HIA practitioners realise that the process does not stop when the report has been produced and the ‘decision’ made.HIA practitioners should try to establish long-term relationships with decision-makers. Gaining the commitment of the ‘health authority/department’ will help achieve this during intersectoral policy development.Where appropriate, include a wide variety of stakeholders in the process, and draw on the best available qualitative and quantitative evidence. Policy makers appreciate these HIA values as they also underpin their own work. The inclusion of local
communities provides policy makers with data and information that is typically hard to get, which is grounded in the realities of the local environment and is rich in experience.Ensure that a longer-term follow-up of the HIA can be made to determine the actual impacts from the policy or project on the health awareness among others, on the health determinants and finally on health itself.

grandchildren or other relatives and friends regularly and thus, in case
of grandchildren, are supporting their children. In Africa, for
example, family support of grandparents plays a particularly important
role supporting children, as the parent's generation has been strongly

f8e41813-2569-4db9-96ec-e6a4ba8d0bc8,How will the global response to the pandemic H1N1 be reviewed?,"The assessment of the global response to the pandemic H1N1 will be conducted by the International Health Regulations Review Committee, a committee of experts with a broad mix of scientific expertise and practical experience in public health. The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields.The International Health Regulations (IHR) is an international legal agreement that is binding on 194 States Parties across the globe, including all of the Member States of WHO. The basic purpose of the IHR is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide.In January 2010, the WHO Executive Board requested a proposal from the Director-General on how to assess the international response to the pandemic influenza, and then approved her suggestion to convene the IHR Review Committee to review both the pandemic response and the functioning of the IHR.The pandemic H1N1 is the first public health emergency of international concern to occur since the revised IHR came into force. The IHR played a central role in the global response to the pandemic and so review of the IHR and review of the global handling of the pandemic influenza are closely related.The IHR facilitate coordinated international action by requiring countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO so that global reporting of important public health events is timely and open.The IHR were first implemented (i.e., ""entered into force"") worldwide in 2007 and the Health Assembly determined that a first review of its functioning is to take place by the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010.ObjectivesThe review has three key objectives:Assess the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005);Assess the ongoing global response to the pandemic H1N1 (including the role of WHO); andIdentify lessons learned important for strengthening preparedness and response for future pandemics and public health emergencies.The committeeThe IHR Review Committee is made up of approximately 29 members who have been selected from the roster of experts under the IHR structure or other WHO expert committees. The committee members represent a broad mix of expertise, practical experience and backgrounds, and includes experts from developed and developing countries.The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields. They are not WHO staff, nor do they receive funding from WHO for their contributions to the review process. Names of the committee members were made public prior to the first meeting:At the first meeting, Professor Harvey V. Fineberg was elected as chair; Professor Babatunde Osotimehin was elected as vice chair.The IHR Review Committee is considered a WHO expert committee and so its operations and structure follows regulations for WHO expert advisory panels and committees, and provisions of the IHR.ProceedingsThe committee will determine its methods and schedule of work.The first meeting is scheduled for 12-14 April 2010 at WHO headquarters in Geneva.Observers invited to the first meeting include representatives of all States Parties to the IHR (194 countries), United Nations organizations and relevant intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations in official relations with WHO.The committee will advise the Director-General of its views and findings. Based on the committee's advice, the Director-General will provide an interim report to the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2010, and an expected second, final report to the WHA in May 2011.Participation by countries (IHR States Parties)Countries will have the opportunity to make brief statements to the committee at first meeting, and may also submit comments to the Review Committee on key issues, concerns and lessons learned related to the pandemic response and functioning of the IHR.More about the IHRIn the globalized world, diseases can rapidly spread far and wide via international travel and trade. A health crisis in one country can impact livelihoods and economies in many parts of the world. Emerging infections such as an influenza pandemic are an important cause of such events. However, other public health emergencies such as chemical spills, leaks and dumping, or nuclear melt-downs may similarly have global effects.The IHR are not specific for any one disease or group of diseases but generally aim to limit interference with international traffic and trade while ensuring public health through the prevention of disease spread. The IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events, and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security. The IHR also require countries to strengthen their existing capacities for public health surveillance and response.(updated from 1 April 2010 version)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/question-and-answer-on-reviewing-global-response-to-h1n1-pandemic

64016214-c1d7-494e-b1dc-31533d6defa1,What are the reasons for using HIA?,"Promotes cross-sectoral workingThe health and well-being of people is determined by a wide range of economic, social and environmental influences. Activities in many sectors beyond the health sector influence these determinants of health. HIA is a participatory approach that helps people from multiple sectors to work together. HIA participants consider the impacts of the proposed action on their individual sector, and other sectors – and the potential impact on health from any change. Overlaps with other policy and project initiatives are often identified, providing a more integrated approach to policy making. ""Joined up thinking"" and ""cross-sectoral working"" are phrases that apply to the HIA way of working.A participatory approach that values the views of the communityAn initial stage within the HIA process is to identify the relevant stakeholders. This process usually produces a large number of relevant people, groups and organizations. The HIA can be used as a framework to implicate stakeholders in a meaningful way, allowing their messages to be heard.Stakeholders commonly include:The local community/public, particularly vulnerable groupsDevelopersPlannersLocal/national governmentsVoluntary agencies, nongovernmental organizationsHealth workers at local, national or international levelsEmployers and unionsRepresentatives of other sectors affected by the proposalThe commissioner(s) of the HIAThe decision-makersThe network of people and organisations who will carry out the HIA.HIA provides a way to engage with members of the public affected by a particular proposal. An HIA can send a signal that an organization or partnership wants to involve a community and is willing to respond constructively to their concerns. Because the HIA process values many different types of evidence during the assessment of a proposal, the views of the public can be considered alongside expert opinion and scientific data, with each source of information being valued equally within the HIA. It is important to note that the decision makers may value certain types of evidence more than others, and community expectations must be managed to avoid ‘over-promising what an HIA can deliver. An HIA does not make decisions; it provides information in a clear and transparent way for decision makers’.The best available evidence is provided to decision-makersThe purpose of an HIA is to provide decision-makers with a set of evidence-based recommendations about the proposal. The decision-makers can then decide to accept, reject or amend the proposal, in the knowledge that they have the best available evidence before them. Evidence used in an HIA can be both qualitative and quantitative, and each is valuable. HIA should consider a range of different types of evidence – going beyond published reviews and research papers, to include the views and opinions of key players who are involved or affected by a proposal. Often, information of the quality and quantity demanded by decision-makers cannot be found, a note of this is made within the HIA and the best available evidence is provided.Improves health and reduces inequalitiesAddressing inequalities and improving health is a goal for many organisations and all governments. One way of contributing to the health and inequalities agenda is through the use of HIA. At the very least, HIA ensures that proposals do not inadvertently damage health or reinforce inequalities. HIA uses a wide model of health and works across sectors to provide a systematic approach for assessing how the proposal affects a population, with particular emphasis on the distribution of effects between different subgroups within the population. Recommendations can specifically target the improvement of health for vulnerable groups.It is a positive approachHIA looks not only for negative impacts (to prevent or reduce them), but also for impacts favourable to health. This provides decision-makers with options to strengthen and extend the positive features of a proposal, with a view to improving the health of the population.Appropriate for policies, programmes and projectsHIA is suitable for use at many different levels. HIA can be used on projects, programmes (groupings of projects) and policies, though it has most commonly been used on projects. The flexibility of HIA allows these projects, programmes and policies to be assessed at either a local, regional, national or international level – making HIA suitable for almost any proposal. However, choosing the right moment to carry out an HIA is important (see screening).TimelinessTo influence the decision-making process, HIA recommendations must reach the decision-makers well before any decisions about the proposal will be made. This basic principle of HIA highlights the practical nature of the approach. Experienced HIA practitioners can work within most timeframes, undertaking comprehensive (longer) or rapid (shorter) HIAs.Links with sustainable development and resource managementIf the HIA is undertaken at a sufficiently early stage in the project process, it can be used as a key tool for sustainable development. For example, an HIA on building a road would enable inclusion of health and other sustainability aspects - such as cycle lanes, noise and speed reduction interventions - to be included from the very beginning, rather than at a later date. This enables health objectives to be considered at the same level as socio-economic and environmental objectives, an important step towards sustainable development. Another feature of HIA is its possible combination with other impact assessment methods. This integration allows proposals to be assessed from a sustainable development perspective including: health, education, employment, business success, safety and security, culture, leisure and recreation, and the environment. Drawing on the wider determinants of health, and working across different sectors, HIA can play an important role in the sustainability agenda.Many people can use HIABecause it is a participatory approach, there are many potential users of HIA, including:Decision-makers who may use the information to select options more favourable to health;Commissioners of the HIA, who use it to consult widely and gather differing views, to build capacity and develop strong partnerships;HIA workers who carry out the individual components of the HIA, including consultants, local staff from a wide variety of organizations, and the community;Stakeholders, who want their views to be considered by decision-makers.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/reasons-for-using-health-impact-assessment-hia
4f063741-43b2-4dd6-9110-0e68b6aa9fba,What are international policies and regulations for HIA?,"Several international policies and regulations make provisions for HIA or recommend its use, such as:Strategic Environmental AssessmentHealth effects are often poorly assessed within Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), or not at all. The establishment of a Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) Protocol – to supplement the UNECE Convention on EIA - has addressed this problem. In Kiev, in May 2003, governments of 35 European United Nations members signed the SEA protocol, whose provisions place special emphasis on human health, going beyond existing legislation. This reflects the political will of the governments, and the technical support of the health sector including WHO. The protocol also recommends that SEA be undertaken early enough in the decision-making process of proposals for environmental and health issues to be considered as part of a wider sustainability agenda.Article 152 of the Amsterdam TreatyThe Treaty calls for the European Union (EU) to examine the possible impact of major policies on health. The treaty states that ""A high level of health protection shall be ensured in connection with the formulation and implementation of all Community policies and all Community measures"". The European Commission's Health Strategy proposal states that policies must ensure that public health aspects be considered in all EU decisions and actions, therefore health impact assessments should be conducted.Environmental Impact AssessmentMany countries have statutory requirements for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be undertaken on every important project. The EU directive on EIA was introduced in 1985 and amended in 1997 and 2003. Country-specific links for environmental and strategic impact assessments can be found at the Impact Assessment Research Centre at the University of Manchester or the International Association for Impact Assessment. Unfortunately, an EIA does not typically include an assessment of the health effects, and when it does, it may be narrowly focused and only quantitative in nature.EU Strategic Environmental DirectiveThe European Commission began negotiations for a directive on the environmental assessment of plans and programmes in 1996. Several amendments to the proposal were made, leading to the SEA Directive being adopted by the European Council on 5 June 2001. The purpose of the SEA-Directive is to ensure that environmental consequences of certain plans and programmes are identified and assessed during their preparation and before their adoption. Member states were required to introduce the directive into their own legislation by 27 June 2004.Health21 – Health for allThe 51 countries comprising the WHO European Region have a common policy framework for health development, which outlines strategies to transform national policies into practical operational programmes at the local level. After consultations with Member States and several important organizations in the Region, four main strategies for action were chosen to ensure that scientific, economic, social and political sustainability drive the implementation of  Health21. The first is that ""multisectoral strategies tackle the determinants of health, taking into account physical, economic, social, cultural and gender perspectives and ensuring the use of health impact assessment"".Environmental Health ConferencesThe 3rd ministerial conference on environmental health, held in London in 1999, recognized access to information, public participation and access to justice in environment and health as important issues. Several countries supported the idea of a protocol on strategic environment and health impact assessment, and the theme was submitted to the following environment and health conference in Budapest, in 2004.Libreville DeclarationIn 2008, the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment in Africa encouraged governments to integrate health and the environment within public policies, poverty reduction strategies and national development plans.

Sub-Saharan Africa faces the greatest challenge and proportionately, is the most heavily affected region of the world. One million health workers are needed to bridge the gap in this region. While it has 25 % of the global burden of disease, it has only 3 % of the world's health workers. There are a cluster of countries in Southern Africa that are undergoing a deep crisis: few health workers, high HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB burden, poorly performing health systems, and the highest rate of migration anywhere in the world, particularly in that region's English-speaking countries.
Due to its considerable share of the world's population, Asia also needs millions of additional health workers to bridge its health workforce gap. The needs are greatest in South Asia, especially in rural areas.In the European or North American media, the 'shortage' of health workers is also often discussed in relation to OECD countries. As populations (and the health workers themselves) are ageing in these countries, health care demand is constantly increasing.Table: ""Inequities in the distribution of health workers worldwide"" (WHO 2006)",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis

Why does the latest HRH report (A Universal Truth – No health without a Workforce, 2013) use a different threshold (33.45/10’000) from the WHO 2006 report(22.8/10’000)?","The 22.8/10,000 population threshold was identified in 2006 to partly illustrate the global shortage of health workers in relation to the objective of delivering essential health services of relevance to the MDGs – primarily MDG 4 and 5. The HRH
‘crisis’ category refers to two dimensions: density of skilled health professionals less than 22.8/10,000 population and deliveries by skilled birth attendants less than 80%; so low HRH density and low service coverage together. Using
this threshold the WHR 2006 identified a shortage of 4.3 million health workers.Almost a decade later, the threshold of 34.5 skilled health professionals (midwives, nurses and physicians) per 10,000 population has emerged in the discourse on universal health coverage, based on the density of health professionals of a country (Thailand)
which has attained very high coverage of a broader range of health services. This threshold comes from analysis conducted by the International Labour Organization in support of its regulation on Social Protection, the World Social Security Statistics
2010/2011. There are currently 100 countries with a density of skilled health professionals below this threshold, translating in a total shortage of about 7.2 million skilled health professionals.Based on projections of a simple model entirely driven by population growth, this gap would increase to 12.9 million by 2035.It is important to note that none of these thresholds are meant to be planning targets, but rather are used to illustrate the variance in HRH availability, and the magnitude of challenges that lie ahead, calling for transformative approaches to planning,
education and management of the health workforce.Thresholds identified to allow comparisons and promote dialogue at global level however have limitations in terms of their use to national policy makers. What is needed is a move towards context-specific identification of needs and opportunities, so that
countries can rather set their own benchmarks, assess progress, and revise them over time as required and as they broaden the scope of health services they intend to provide to the population.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis

But the grave effects of health workforce migration on developing countries call for a responsible, regulated management of migration, with a critical aim that all countries move towards self-sufficiency.Some countries specifically train health workers for 'export'. Bilateral agreements between 'importing' and 'exporting' countries need to be encouraged to protect the rights of the health worker and offer some guarantee of employment level in the 'importing'
country.The Alliance and several of its partners, in particular WHO, is also working on a Global Code of Practice on ethical international recruitment of health workers. This instrument will be designed to ensure that all best practices are followed and protect

9f77a4bf-eb7d-4e02-bff6-37e6bb64c03a,How long might the health workforce crisis last?,"Health systems are not easily or rapidly strengthened or reformed. Scaling up 'production' (educating and training more health workers) is the initial stage but this can take time: a nursing qualification usually takes three years of training, and a physician
at least five. Innovative methods (distance learning, 'task shifting' or community health worker programmes) can shorten this delay effect, but there is no ""quick fix"" to this problem: community health workers, nurses and physicians need each other
to work effectively as teams.More schools and teachers are also needed to really 'scale up', although technical advances (distance learning, IT) and increased twinning between schools can and should be used to enable this surge of students. Significant financial support and technical
cooperation are also necessary for improving a decaying infrastructure, as well as institutional development for improving the quality of education.The next step is employment, which brings challenges of its own: many countries affected by the health worker shortage already have scores of unemployed health workers: public spending on health may be capped (due to macroeconomic constraints), and private
enterprise may not be an option for individual health workers. Many countries thus lack the capacity to employ the workforce they have trained.If nothing is done, the crisis will worsen. If action is taken – as recommended by WHO, The Alliance and many field experts – with strong country ownership and leadership, stakeholder consultation, national and international funding, the crisis

a371fb31-a569-49be-a873-5091a1ffd53a,How does safe water impact global health?,"Safe water supplies, hygienic sanitation and good water management are fundamental to global health. Almost one tenth of the global disease burden could be prevented by:

increasing access to safe drinking water;
improving sanitation and hygiene; and
improving water management to reduce risks of water-borne infectious diseases, and accidental drowning during recreation.

Annually, safer water could prevent:

1.4 million child deaths from diarrhoea;
500 000 deaths from malaria;
860 000 child deaths from malnutrition; and
280 000 deaths from drowning.

In addition, 5 million people can be protected from being seriously incapacitated from lymphatic filariasis and another 5 million from trachoma.
Recommended measures
Efforts to improve water, sanitation and hygiene interact with each other to boost overall health. Access to sanitation, such as simple latrines in communities, prevents drinking water contamination from human waste and reduces infections. High-tech public health measures are not necessarily the best: frequent hand-washing with soap and safe storage of drinking water are high-impact practices.
Environmental management effectively lowers the rates of malaria and other diseases spread by insects and prevents death. These measures include eliminating habitats - such as standing water - for breeding, and screening doors and windows for protection from mosquitoes.
Economic benefits
Investment to improve drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and water resource management systems makes strong economic sense: every dollar invested leads to up to eight dollars in benefits. US$ 84 billion a year could be regained from the yearly investment of US$ 11.3 billion needed to meet the water and sanitation targets under the Millennium Development Goals.
In addition to the value of saved human lives, other benefits include higher economic productivity, more education, and health-care savings.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/how-does-safe-water-impact-global-health
8fee77be-2791-4780-8a9f-0cea1f8d4862,What is radar?,"Radar systems detect the presence, direction or range of aircraft, ships or other, usually moving objects. This is achieved by sending pulses of high frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF). Invented some 60 years ago, radar systems have been widely used for navigation, aviation, national defence and weather forecasting. Their primary objective is individual and collective safety and protection.People who live or routinely work around radars have expressed concerns about long-term adverse effects of these systems on health, including cancer, reproductive malfunction, cataracts and changes in behaviour or development of children. A recent example has been the alleged increase in testicular cancer in police using speed control handheld radar guns.It is important to distinguish between perceived and real dangers that radars pose, as well as to understand the rationale behind existing international standards and protective measures used today.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
7e70fd07-0539-4eb9-b79b-f325d30badd6,Are EMF emissions dangerous?,"Radars usually operate at radio frequencies (RF) between 300 MHz and 15 GHz. They generate EMFs that are called RF fields. RF fields within this part of the electromagnetic spectrum are known to interact differently with human body.RF fields below 10 GHz (to 1 MHz) penetrate exposed tissues and produce heating due to energy absorption. The depth of penetration depends on the frequency of the field and is greater for lower frequencies. Absorption of RF fields in tissues is measured as a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) within a given tissue mass. The unit of SAR is watts per kilogram (W/kg). SAR is the quantity used to measure the dose of RF fields between about 1 MHz and 10 GHz.An SAR of at least 4 W/kg is needed to produce known adverse health effects in people exposed to RF fields in this frequency range.RF fields above 10 GHz are absorbed at the skin surface, with very little of the energy penetrating into the underlying tissues. The basic dosimetric quantity for RF fields above 10 GHz is the intensity of the field measured as power density in watts per square metre (W/m2) or for weak fields in milliwatts per square metre (mW/m2) or microwatts per square metre (µW/m2).Exposure to RF fields above 10 GHz at power densities over 1000 W/m2 are known to produce adverse health effects, such as eye cataracts and skin burns.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
235142b7-52c9-4de0-bd59-6aea81711ff1,When are humans exposed to dangerous amounts of radio frequencies?,"The power that radar systems emit varies from a few milliwatts (police traffic control radar) to many kilowatts (large space tracking radars). However, a number of factors significantly reduce human exposure to RF generated by radar systems, often by a factor of at least 100:Radar systems send electromagnetic waves in pulses and not continuously. This makes the average power emitted much lower than the peak pulse power.Radars are directional and the RF energy they generate is contained in beams that are very narrow and resemble the beam of a spotlight. RF levels away from the main beam fall off rapidly. In most cases, these levels are thousands of times lower than in the main beam.Many radars have antennas which are continuously rotating or varying their elevation by a nodding motion, thus constantly changing the direction of the beam.Areas, where dangerous human exposure may occur are normally inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
5b855baa-7bf6-486d-ac25-ac0e78f256ce,Where are radars used?,"Some of the common types of radars encountered in daily life include the following.Air traffic control radars are used to track the location of aircraft and to control their landing at airports. They are generally located at elevated positions where the beam is inaccessible to persons on the ground. Typical air traffic control radars can have peak powers of 100 kW or more, but average powers of a few hundred watts. Under normal operating conditions, these systems pose no hazard to the general public.Weather radars are often co-located with air traffic control radars in remote areas at airports. They operate at higher frequencies but generally have lower average and peak powers. As with air traffic control radars, under normal conditions, they pose no hazards to the public.Military radars are numerous and vary from large installations, which have high peak (1 MW or greater) and average powers (kW), to small military fire control radars, typically found on aircraft. Large size radars often evoke concern in communities living around them. However, because its power is radiated over a large surface area, the power densities associated with these systems vary between 10 and 100 W/m2 within the site boundary. Outside the site boundary RF field levels are usually unmeasurable without using sophisticated equipment. However, small military fire control radars on aircraft can be hazardous to ground personnel. These units have relatively high average powers (kW) and small area antennas, making it possible to have power densities up to 10 kW/m2. Members of the public would not be exposed to these emissions because during ground testing of radars access to these areas by all personnel is prohibited. The military also use most other types of radars described below.Marine radars can be found on small pleasure boats to large ocean going vessels. Peak powers of these systems can reach up to 30 kW, with average powers ranging from 1 to 25 W. Under normal operating conditions, with the antenna rotating, the average power density of the higher power systems within a metre of the antenna is usually less than 10 W/m2. In accessible areas on most watercraft, these levels would fall to a few percent of present public RF exposure standards.Speed control radars are hand-held by police in many countries. The average output power is very low - a few milliwatts - and so the units are not considered hazardous to health, even when used in very close proximity to the body.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
2c0f9482-6121-455b-86e3-1c10ea29e752,What are the possible health effects of radar?,"Most studies conducted to date examined health effects other than cancer. They probed into physiological and thermoregulatory responses, behavioural changes and effects such as the induction of lens opacities (cataracts) and adverse reproductive outcome following acute exposure to relatively high levels of RF fields. There are also a number of studies that report non-thermal effects, where no appreciable rise in temperature can be measured.Cancer-related studies: Many epidemiological studies have addressed possible links between exposure to RF and excess risk of cancer. However, because of differences in the design and execution of these studies, their results are difficult to interpret. A number of national and international peer review groups have concluded that there is no clear evidence of links between RF exposure and excess risk of cancer. WHO has also concluded that there is no convincing scientific evidence that exposure to RF shortens the life span of humans, or that RF is an inducer or promoter of cancer. However, further studies are necessary.Thermal effects: RF fields have been studied in animals, including primates. The earliest signs of an adverse health consequence, found in animals as the level of RF fields increased, include reduced endurance, aversion of the field and decreased ability to perform mental tasks. These studies also suggest adverse effects may occur in humans subjected to whole body or localized exposure to RF fields sufficient to increase tissue temperatures by greater than 1°C. Possible effects include the induction of eye cataracts, and various physiological and thermoregulatory responses as body temperature increases. These effects are well established and form the scientific basis for restricting occupational and public exposure to RF fields.Non-thermal effects: Exposure to RF levels too low to involve heating, (i.e., very low SARs), has been reported by several groups to alter calcium ion mobility, which is responsible for transmitting information in tissue cells. However, these effects are not sufficiently established to provide a basis for restricting human exposure.Pulsed RF fields: Exposure to very intense pulsed RF fields, similar to those used by radar systems, has been reported to suppress the startle response and evoke body movements in conscious mice. In addition, people with normal hearing have perceived pulse RF fields with frequencies between about 200 MHz and 6.5 GHz. This is called the microwave hearing effect. The sound has been variously described as a buzzing, clicking, hissing or popping sound, depending on the RF pulsing characteristics. Prolonged or repeated exposure may be stressful and should be avoided where possible.RF shocks and burns: charges induced on metallic objects situated near radars. Persons standing in RF fields can also have high local absorption of the fields in areas of their bodies with small cross sectional areas, such as the ankles. In general, because of the higher frequencies that most modern radar systems operate, combined with their small beam widths, the potential for such effects is very small.Electromagnetic interference: Radars can cause electromagnetic interference in other electronic equipment. The thresholds for these effects are often well below guidance levels for human exposure to RF fields. Additionally, radars can also cause interference in certain medical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers and hearing aids. If individuals using such devices work near radar systems, they should contact manufacturers to determine the susceptibility of their products to RF interference.Ignition of flammable liquids and explosives: RF fields can ignite flammable liquids and explosives through the induction of currents. This is a rare occurrence, and normally of most concern where there is a large concentration of radars, such as on board a naval ship where measures are taken to prevent such effects.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
b14c2cae-1fb2-4787-b26d-3dec985c28f5,What international standards regulate radar?,"Exposure limits for RF fields are developed by international bodies such as the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). ICNIRP is a non-governmental organization formally recognised by WHO. The Commission uses health risk assessments developed in conjunction with WHO to draft their guidelines on exposure limits. The ICNIRP guidelines protect against all established RF health effects and are developed following reviews of all the peer-reviewed scientific literature, including reports on cancer and non-thermal effects. Environmental RF levels from radars, in areas normally accessible to the general public, are at least 1,000 times below the limits for continuous public exposure allowed by the ICNIRP guidelines, and 25,000 times below the level at which RF exposure has been established to cause the earliest known health effects.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
0d82bc6e-b0d9-4af4-94ae-c782f4b400ab,What other protective measures are in place?,"The aim of protective measures is to eliminate or reduce human exposure to RF fields below acceptable limits. An extensive program of measurement surveys, hazard communication, coupled with effective protective measures, is required around all radar installations. In most countries, comprehensive documentation is prepared, including an environmental impact statement, before a radar system can be constructed.Following construction of the radar facility, site surveys should be performed to quantify RF field levels in the area. While extremely high RF field levels can be measured directly in front of a radar, in most cases levels in public areas are not easily measurable. In order to prevent both workers and the general public from entering areas where the RF levels are above the limits, both engineering and administrative controls are used.Engineering controls include interlocks, electronic means to exclude the radar pointing in certain areas, and shielding.Administrative controls include audible and visible alarms, warning signs, and restriction of access through barriers, locked doors, or limiting access time to radar.When engineering and administrative controls do not suffice, workers should use personal protective equipment to ensure compliance with exposure standards. Conductive suits, gloves, safety shoes and other types of personal protective equipment for RF fields are now commercially available.They should be used with great care, since the attenuation properties of the material used to make this protective equipment can vary dramatically with frequency. Only when the attenuation properties of the equipment are known at the frequency in question can they be used reliably.Special care should be exercised with RF safety glasses since any metal may enhance local fields by acting as a receiving antenna.There are no exposure situations where members of the public need to use protective equipment for RF fields from radars.In recent years, clothing and other materials have appeared on the consumer market claiming to have RF shielding properties and directing their claims to soc-called sensitive members of the general population, such as pregnant women. The use of these types of products is unnecessary and should be discouraged. They offer no effective RF shielding, and there is no need for these devices.Human exposure to EMF emitted by radar systems is limited by international standards and protective measures, which were adopted on the basis the currently available scientific evidence.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar
343d8b93-1dc1-4ee1-988f-00d508294350,In summary,"RF fields cause molecules in tissue to vibrate and generate heat. Heating effects could be expected if time is spent directly in front of some radar antennas, but are not  possible at the environmental levels of RF fields emanating from radar systems.To produce any adverse health effect, RF exposure above a threshold level must occur. The known threshold level is the exposure needed to increase tissue temperature by at least 1oC. The very low RF environmental field levels from radar systems cannot cause any significant temperature rise.To date, researchers have not found evidence that multiple exposures to RF fields below threshold levels cause any adverse health effects. No accumulation of damage occurs to tissues from repeated low level RF exposure.At present, there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects, including cancer, can occur in people exposed to RF levels at or below the limits set by international standards. However, more research is needed to fill certain gaps in knowledge.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-radar

This reference was based on data from several samples of children from a single
country and suffers from a number of technical and biological drawbacks that make it inadequate to monitor the rapid and changing rate of early childhood growth.Under the leadership of WHO, the United Nations in 1993 undertook a comprehensive review of the uses and interpretation of child growth references. The review concluded that it was time to develop new standards that show how children should grow in all
countries rather than merely describing how they grew at a particular time and place.Following this review, in 1994, the World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed the development of a new set of tools to assess infant and young child growth. The Assembly stressed the need to move beyond past approaches and toward the more desirable goal of
describing how all children should grow when their needs are met.In setting this ambitious goal, WHO and its principal partner, the United Nations University, in collaboration with a number of academic institutions worldwide, undertook the Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), a community-based, multi-country
project to develop new growth standards for infants and young children.The study involved the recruitment of children who met a number of health criteria in 6 countries representing different regions of the world: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States. The 8,440 children included in the study were raised
in environments that minimized constraints to growth such as poor diets and infection. In addition, their mothers followed health practices such as breastfeeding their children and not smoking during and after pregnancy.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/child-growth-standards
cac16d64-b574-4da0-b426-8952c5cbf644,How different are the new standards from the old growth charts?,"The new standards differ from any existing growth charts in a number of innovative ways. First, the MGRS was designed to provide data that describe “how children should grow,” by including in the study’s selection criteria specific health
behaviours that are consistent with current health promotion recommendations (e.g., breastfeeding norms, standard pediatric care, non-smoking requirements). This new approach is fundamentally different from that taken by the traditional descriptive references. By adopting a prescriptive approach, the protocol’s design went beyond an update of how children in presumably healthy populations grow at a
specific time and place and explicitly recognize the need for standards (i.e., devices that enable value judgments by incorporating norms or targets in their construction). Arguably, the current obesity epidemic in many developed countries would
have been detectable earlier if a prescriptive international standard had been available 20 years ago.Another key characteristic of the new standard is that it makes breastfeeding the biological “norm” and establishes the breastfed infant as the normative growth model. The previous reference was based on the growth of artificially-fed children.The pooled sample from the 6 participating countries will allow the development of a truly international standard (in contrast to the previous international reference based on children from a single country) and reiterate the fact that child populations
grow similarly across the world’s major regions when their needs for health and care are met.These standards also include new innovative growth indicators beyond height and weight that are particularly useful for monitoring the increasing epidemic of childhood obesity, such as the skinfold thickness. The study’s longitudinal nature will also allow the development of growth velocity standards. Health care providers will not have to wait until children cross an attained growth threshold to make the diagnosis of under-nutrition and overweight since
velocity standards will enable the early identification of children in the process of becoming under- or over-nourished. Lastly, the development of accompanying windows of achievement for six key motor development milestones will provide a unique link between physical growth and motor development.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/child-growth-standards
ef2f5533-9316-4bc5-9466-58c4a91df898,Do these new standards change current estimates of overweight and undernutrition in children?,"Yes, estimates are going to change because of differences in the pattern of growth between the new standards and the old reference, especially during infancy. The magnitude of the change in the estimates however will vary by age, sex, growth indicator,
and the underlying nutritional status in the population being evaluated.A notable effect is that stunting (low height for age) will be greater throughout childhood when assessed using the new WHO standards compared to the previous international reference. There will be a substantial increase in underweight rates during the first half of infancy (i.e., 0-6 months) and a decrease thereafter. For wasting (low weight for length/height), the main difference between the new standards and the old reference is during infancy (i.e., up to about 70 cm length) when wasting rates will be substantially higher using the new WHO standards. With respect
to overweight, use of the new WHO standards will result in a greater prevalence that will vary by age, sex and nutritional status of the index population.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/child-growth-standards

For the first 6 months, mothers need to be informed and empowered to practice exclusive breastfeeding. Children should be provided safe, wholesome, and nutritionally appropriate foods during the period of complementary feeding and after the second year when breastfeeding has ceased. Sound nutritional practices are important throughout childhood. Appropriate national guidelines should be developed to aid caregivers in choosing nutritious local foods incorrect combinations and amounts to feed their children in order to maintain optimal growth in later childhood (the aim being to avoid both nutritional deficiencies and excesses).Vaccinations and good health care should be available and accessible to all infants and young children. Families and their communities should do all they can to ensure that mothers have a good pregnancy.Nationally, full implementation of the objectives of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (2002) would go a long way in creating supportive environments for mothers to breastfeed their children. The new standard can help stimulate change that facilitates these improvements.

Metallic materials totally reflect microwaves while non-metallic materials such as glass and some plastics are mostly transparent to microwaves.Materials containing water, for example foods, fluids or tissues, readily absorb microwave energy, which is then converted into heat. This Information Sheet discusses the operation and safety aspects of microwave ovens used in the home. More details about the nature of electromagnetic fields and health effects of radiofrequency and microwave fields are available in WHO Fact Sheets 182 and 183.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-microwave-ovens
e5c881a2-051c-46fc-98a7-51ea0fb07092,Are microwave ovens safe?,"When used according to manufacturers' instructions, microwave ovens are safe and convenient for heating and cooking a variety of foods. However, several precautions need to be taken, specifically with regards to potential exposure to microwaves, thermal burns and food handling.Microwave safety: The design of microwave ovens ensures that the microwaves are contained within the oven and can only be present when the oven is switched on and the door is shut. Leakage around and through the glass door is limited by design to a level well below that recommended by international standards. However, microwave leakage could still occur around damaged, dirty or modified microwave ovens. It is therefore important that the oven is maintained in good condition. Users should check that the door closes properly and that the safety interlock devices, fitted to the door to prevent microwaves from being generated while it is open, work correctly. The door seals should be kept clean and there should be no visible signs of damage to the seals or the outer casing of the oven. If any faults are found or parts of the oven are damaged, it should not be used until it has been repaired by an appropriately qualified service engineer.Microwave energy can be absorbed by the body and produce heat in exposed tissues. Organs with a poor blood supply and temperature control, such as the eye, or temperature-sensitive tissue like the testes, have a higher risk of heat damage. However, thermal damage would only occur from long exposures to very high power levels, well in excess of those measured around microwave ovens.Thermal safety: Burn injuries can result from handling hot items heated in a microwave oven, in the same way as items heated using conventional ovens or cooking surfaces. However, heating food in a microwave oven presents some peculiarities. Boiling water on a conventional stove allows steam to escape through bubbling action as the water begins to boil. In a microwave oven there may be no bubbles on the walls of the container and the water will super-heat and may suddenly boil. This sudden boiling may be triggered by a single bubble in the liquid or by the introduction of a foreign element such as a spoon. People have been severely burned by super-heated water.Another peculiarity of microwave cooking relates to the thermal response of specific foods. Certain items with non-porous surfaces (e.g. hotdogs) or composed of materials that heat at different rates (e.g. yolk and white of eggs) heat unevenly and may explode. This can happen if eggs or chestnuts are cooked in their shells.Food safety: Food safety is an important health issue. In a microwave oven, the rate of heating depends on the power rating of the oven and on the water content, density and amount of food being heated. Microwave energy does not penetrate well in thicker pieces of food, and may produce uneven cooking. This can lead to a health risk if parts of the food are not heated sufficiently to kill potentially dangerous micro-organisms. Because of the potential for uneven distribution of cooking, food heated in a microwave oven should rest for several minutes after cooking is completed to allow the heat to distribute throughout the food.Food cooked in a microwave oven is as safe, and has the same nutrient value, as food cooked in a conventional oven. The main difference between these two methods of cooking is that microwave energy penetrates deeper into the food and reduces the time for heat to be conducted throughout the food, thus reducing the overall cooking time.Only certain microwave ovens are designed to sterilize items (for example baby’s milk bottles). The user should follow the manufacturer's instructions for this type of application.Misconceptions: To dispel some misconceptions, it is important to realize that food cooked in a microwave oven does not become ""radioactive"". Nor does any microwave energy remain in the cavity or the food after the microwave oven is switched off. In this respect, microwaves act just like light; when the light bulb is turned off, no light remains.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-microwave-ovens
c5d46650-c053-4a20-814f-c675a7e4ec2b,How do microwave ovens work?,"Domestic microwave ovens operate at a frequency of 2450 MHz with a power usually ranging from 500 to 1100 watts. Microwaves are produced by an electronic tube called a magnetron. Once the oven is switched on, the microwaves are dispersed in the oven cavity and reflected by a stirrer fan so the microwaves are propagated in all directions. They are reflected by the metal sides of the oven cavity and absorbed by the food. Uniformity of heating in the food is usually assisted by having the food on a rotating turntable in the oven. Water molecules vibrate when they absorb microwave energy, and the friction between the molecules results in heating which cooks the food.Unlike conventional ovens, microwaves are absorbed only in the food and not in the surrounding oven cavity. Only dishes and containers specifically designed for microwave cooking should be used. Certain materials, such as plastics not suitable for microwave oven, may melt or burst into flames if overheated. Microwaves do not directly heat food containers which are designed for microwave cooking. These materials usually get warm only from being in contact with the hot food.Oven manufacturers do not recommend operating an empty oven. In the absence of food, the microwave energy can reflect back into the magnetron and may damage it.Microwave oven users should carefully read and comply with the manufacturer’s instructions because new ovens vary widely in design and performance. While most modern ovens can tolerate some food packaging made of metal, oven manufacturers generally recommend not placing metal in the oven, particularly not close to the walls, as this could cause electrical arcing and damage the oven walls. Also, because metal reflects microwaves, food wrapped in metal foil will not be cooked, while food not in metal wrap may receive more energy than intended, causing uneven cooking.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-microwave-ovens
ed5ee68d-cbb6-4b74-87e0-3e1069d70742,International standards,"Several countries, as well as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (ICES) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), have set a product emission limit of 50 watts per square metre (W/m2) at any point 5 cm away from the external surfaces of the oven. In practice, emissions from modern domestic microwave ovens are substantially below this international limit, and have interlocks that prevent people being exposed to microwaves while the oven is on. Moreover, exposure decreases rapidly with distance; e.g. a person 50 cm from the oven receives about one one-hundredth of the microwave exposure of a person 5 cm away.These product emission limits are defined for the purpose of compliance testing, not specifically exposure protection. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has published guidelines on exposure limits for the whole EMF part of the spectrum. Exposure guidelines in the microwave range are set at a level that prevents any known adverse health effect. Exposure limits for workers and for the general public are set well below levels where any hazardous heating occurs from microwave exposure.

The more HIV-1 viral particles in the blood, the faster the CD4+ T-cells are likely destroyed and the faster the progress toward AIDS.How are CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV viral load used?CD4+ T-cell counts are used, together with the Viral Load test, to get a complete picture about how the immune system is fighting the virus. As HIV reproduces within the body, the viral load increases and HIV destroys the CD4+ T-cells and thus lowers the amount of cells present. Generally, the higher the HIV viral load, the more CD4+ T-cells are being destroyed. The goals are to keep CD4+ T-cell count high and viral load low.The number of CD4+ T-cells and virus levels will guide a patient and their doctor in deciding when to start anti-viral treatment.Monitoring CD4+ T-cell counts and viral loads during treatment helps the doctor assess how well the patient responds to their prescribed treatment.How is Viral Load measured?The viral load test should consistently detect and measure virus levels down to 50 copies/mL, have a high specificity and provide reproducible results.

In addition, most people will tan from the UV stimulation of melanin production, which occurs within a few days following exposure. A further, less obvious adaptive effect is the thickening of the outermost layers of the skin that attenuates UV penetration to the deeper layers of the skin. Both changes are a sign of damage to the skin.Susceptibility to skin damage depends on skin type; individuals with fairer skin will be more prone to sunburn or erythema, than people with darker skin Similarly, the ability to adapt to UV exposure (able to tan) also depends on skin type.Chronic exposure to UV radiation also causes a number of degenerative changes in the cells, fibrous tissue and blood vessels of the skin. These include freckles, nevi and lentigines, which are pigmented areas of the skin, and diffuse brown pigmentation. UV radiation accelerates skin aging, and the gradual loss of the skin’s elasticity results in wrinkles and dry, coarse skin.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/Radiation-effects-of-ultraviolet-(uv)-radiation-on-the-skin-eyes-and-immune-system

Bright light activates the constriction of the pupil and the squinting reflex to minimize the penetration of the sun’s rays into the eye. However, the effectiveness of these natural defences in protecting against the dangers of UV radiation is limited under extreme conditions such as sunbed use or strong ground reflection from sand, water and snow. Acute effects of UV radiation exposure include photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis. These inflammatory reactions are comparable to a sunburn of the very sensitive skin-like tissues of the eyeball and eyelids, and usually appear within a few hours of exposure. Both can be very painful, but are reversible and do not result in any long-term damage to the eye or vision. Extreme forms of photokeratitis are 'arc-eye' and 'snow blindness'.Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world. Proteins in the eye’s lens unravel, tangle and accumulate pigments that cloud the lens and eventually lead to blindness.

eb331117-4b85-4d80-8b65-5bd5f4e389b1,How does UV effect the immune system?,"The immune system is the body’s defence mechanism against infections and cancers, and is normally very effective at recognizing and responding to an invading micro-organism or the onset of a tumour. Although the data remain preliminary, there is increasing evidence for a systematic immunosuppressive effect of both acute and low-dose UV radiation exposure.Animal experiments have demonstrated that UV radiation can modify the course and severity of skin tumours. Also, people treated with immunosuppressive drugs have a greater incidence of squamous cell carcinoma than the normal population. Consequently, beyond its role in the initiation of skin cancer, sun exposure may reduce the body’s defences that normally limit the progressive development of skin tumours.Several studies have demonstrated that exposure to environmental levels of UV radiation alters the activity and distribution of some of the cells responsible for triggering immune responses in humans. Consequently, sun exposure may enhance the risk of infection with viral, bacterial, parasitic or fungal infections, which has been demonstrated in a variety of animal models. Furthermore, especially in countries of the developing world, high UV radiation levels may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Since many vaccine-preventable diseases are extremely infectious, any factor that results in even a small decrease in vaccine efficacy can have a major impact on public health.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/Radiation-effects-of-ultraviolet-(uv)-radiation-on-the-skin-eyes-and-immune-system

Tanning parlours use different types of sunbeds, some emitting more, some emitting less UVB as compared to UVA.

This was based on the experience that excessively UVB-rich sunbeds easily cause intermittent overexposures and risks of acute sunburns with a possible increased melanoma risk. On the other hand, excessive UVA exposure has lately been discussed as a possible melanoma risk factor in the scientific and regulatory community. Many sunbed manufacturers are now returning to relative amounts of UVA and UVB that mimic the natural composition in sunlight.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-sunbeds
bdbdefe3-7387-4bb7-bcde-d2bb4c68d2b2,How do sunbeds produce a tan?,"Sunbeds mainly emit UVA radiation which activates the melanin pigment already embedded in the upper skin cells. This immediate tan begins to fade within a few hours after cessation of exposure, but can persist following sufficient and repeated exposure. The small amounts of UVB emitted by sunbeds induce the so-called delayed tanning reaction, where new melanin is produced and distributed between the upper skin cells.Increasing numbers of people rely on sunbeds for whole-body tanning and to tan beyond their normal complexion. This forced tanning is associated with DNA damage in melanocytes, the cells that produce the dark-coloured melanin pigment in the skin. In genetically dark-skinned individuals, relatively little DNA damage is sufficient to bring about the extra-tanning effect. In contrast forced tanning in fair-skinned individuals is associated with a lot of DNA damage. It is mainly fair-skinned people who are keen to darken their complexion.Sunbeds are not as successful in producing a tan as the people using them would like them to be. A recent British survey reported that only 2/3 of the regular sunbed users interviewed had achieved moderate tanning, while 1/3 had gained a mild tan; some also reported patchy tanning.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-sunbeds

But more importantly, a tan is no defence against long-term UV damage such as skin cancer.Sunbeds mainly emit UVA radiation, which produces a tanning effect by increasing the amount of melanin pigment in the upper skin layers. Even though this is designed as a defence against further UV damage, the darkening as such provides little extra protection.

The use of eye protection such as goggles or sunglasses should be mandatory. However, as sunbed users aim to have an even tan, they often decide against protecting any part of their body.Users have reported a range of short-term symptoms including itching, dryness and redness of skin, freckling and photosensitivity.

b40bdbb3-f6e2-4e25-89ef-01d91b924a1c,Sunbed use as a melanoma time bomb?,"The new technology sunbeds are said to emit ""safe"" UV radiation. However, the original presumption that UVA is a safe form of UV radiation does not hold. If nothing else, it enhances skin ageing but, most likely, UVA also plays a role in skin cancer promotion. So what about the ""healthy tan"" that many manufacturers advertize? The results of a few simple measurements and calculations should suffice to put such claims into perspective:Average UVA levels of sunbeds easily reach midday solar UVA levels in the United Kingdom, but some sunbeds may exceed maximum values up to 20 times.UVB levels of sunbeds may be as low as 1/20 of the maximum solar UVB levels during the British summer, however, they may also exceed them threefold.Assuming the average UVA and UVB levels of the sunbeds tested, the carcinogenic effect of sunbed use over a period of 10 minutes corresponds with an exposure to 10 minutes of Mediterranean summer sun. Regular sunbed use therefore contributes significant amounts to the user's annual UV radiation exposure, especially as it involves whole-body exposure - the exposed skin area in sunbed tanning is at least twice as large as the average sunbather's.Even though the causes of malignant melanoma are not fully understood, tumour development appears to be linked to occasional exposure to intense sunlight. Curiously, tumours are most frequent on body sites that are rarely exposed to the sun. Sunbeds subject their users to intermittent high exposures of UVA and UVB radiation – this may provide the ideal setting for the development of malignant skin cancer. However, the few epidemiological studies that have been carried out to date have not provided any consistent results.Tanning beyond the normal complexion is associated with DNA damage in melanocytes, the cells that produce the dark-coloured melanin pigment in the skin. Even a small tanning effect requires a lot of DNA damage in the fair-skinned population. Therefore, regular use of sunbeds will significantly increase your chances of getting skin cancer if you are fair-skinned. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection states that ""the use of sunbeds for cosmetic purposes is not recommended."" Regular exposure should not exceed two sessions per week with a maximum of 30 sessions per year. Australian cancer control organizations go even further, calling for tanning salons and advertizements for sunbeds to display health warnings – similar to those required on cigarette packets.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-sunbeds

Shade, clothing and hats provide the best protection – applying sunscreen becomes necessary on those parts of the body that remain exposed like the face and hands. Sunscreen should never be used to prolong the duration of sun exposure.Limit time in the midday sunThe sun’s UV rays are the strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. To the extent possible, limit exposure to the sun during these hours.Watch for the  UV indexThis important resource helps you plan your outdoor activities in ways that prevent overexposure to the sun’s rays. While you should always take precautions against overexposure, take special care to adopt sun safety practices when the UV Index predicts exposure levels of moderate or above.Use shade wiselySeek shade when UV rays are the most intense, but keep in mind that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or canopies do not offer complete sun protection.

Beyond the health benefits, effective education programmes can strengthen national economies by reducing the financial burden to health care systems caused by skin cancer and cataract treatments.Children are in a dynamic state of growth, and are therefore more susceptible to environmental threats than adults. Many vital functions such as the immune system are not fully developed at birth, and unsafe environments may interfere with their normal development.Schools are vitally important settings to promote sun protection and effective programmes can make a difference",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-sun-protection

Schools are an excellent place to teach healthy behaviors that can prevent overexposure to UV radiation. In an environment that is geared towards learning school children are especially susceptible to fashion trends, while teachers can play a major role in influencing children’s knowledge, attitudes and behavior regarding sun protection.An effective campaign can have an enormous impact on public health: the SunSmart Campaign (Fig. 2) of The Cancer Council Victoria in Australia, has made significant progress in raising awareness of the issues of sun protection and skin cancer as well as encouraging changes in sun-related lifestyle.A school program on sun protection should adopt an integrated approach to help students, teachers, and the wider community to avoid health risks of UV radiation exposure. The program should include sun protection education, a healthy school environment, a school-endorsed sun protection policy, and community and family involvement. An evaluation of school programs to promote sun protection is a powerful tool that WHO recommends for implementing and strengthening school health programs. Activities are most effective if they have a practical focus and are relevant to the students’ own experiences. Sun protection can easily be integrated into a range of curriculum areas.WHO has developed a comprehensive package of materials for children’s sun protection education. It is intended for Ministries of Health and Education, as well as national and local authorities and non-governmental organizations active in the area of health promotion and sun protection programs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-sun-protection
