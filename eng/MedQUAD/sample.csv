"Tetralogy tehTRALoje of Fallot fahLO is a congenital heart defect This is a problem with the hearts structure thats present at birth Congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart
                
Tetralogy of Fallot is a rare complex heart defect It occurs in about 5out of every 10000 babies The defect affects boys and girls equally
                
To understand tetralogy of Fallot it helps to know how a healthy heart works The Health Topics How the Heart Works article describes the structure and function of a healthy heart The article also has animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your hearts electrical system works
                
Overview
                
Tetralogy of Fallot involves four heart defects
                
A large ventricular septal defect VSD
                
Pulmonary PULLmunary stenosis
                
Right ventricular hypertrophy hiPERtrofe
                
An overriding aorta
                
Ventricular Septal Defect
                
The heart has an inner wall that separates the two chambers on its left side from the two chambers on its right side This wall is called a septum The septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart
                
A VSD is a hole in the septum between the hearts two lower chambers the ventricles The hole allows oxygenrich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle
                
Pulmonary Stenosis
                
This defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery
                
Normally oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery From there the blood travels to the lungs to pick up oxygen
                
In pulmonary stenosis the pulmonary valve cannot fully open Thus the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve As a result not enough blood reaches the lungs
                
Right Ventricular Hypertrophy
                
With this defect the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual This occurs because the heart has to work harder than normal to move blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve
                
Overriding Aorta
                
This defect occurs in the aorta the main artery that carries oxygenrich blood from the heart to the body In a healthy heart the aorta is attached to the left ventricle This allows only oxygenrich blood to flow to the body
                
In tetralogy of Fallot the aorta is located between the left and right ventricles directly over the VSD As a result oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle flows directly into the aorta instead of into the pulmonary artery
                
Outlook
                
With tetralogy of Fallot not enough blood is able to reach the lungs to get oxygen and oxygenpoor blood flows to the body
                
CrossSection of a Normal Heart and a Heart With Tetralogy of Fallot
                

                
Babies and children who have tetralogy of Fallot have episodes of cyanosis siahNOsis Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin lips and fingernails It occurs because the oxygen level in the blood leaving the heart is below normal
                
Tetralogy of Fallot is repaired with openheart surgery either soon after birth or later in infancy The timing of the surgery will depend on how narrow the pulmonary artery is
                
Over the past few decades the diagnosis and treatment of tetralogy of Fallot have greatly improved Most children who have this heart defect survive to adulthood However theyll need lifelong medical care from specialists to help them stay as healthy as possible",What is are Tetralogy of Fallot

"Risk Factors
    
The people most likely to be infected with pinworm are children under 18 people who take care of infected children and people who are institutionalized In these groups the prevalence can reach 50
    
Pinworm is the most common worm infection in the United States Humans are the only species that can transfer this parasite Household pets like dogs and cats cannot become infected with human pinworms Pinworm eggs can survive in the indoor environment for 2 to 3 weeks
    Epidemiology
    
Pinworm infections are more common within families with schoolaged children in primary caregivers of infected children and in institutionalized children
    
A person is infected with pinworms by ingesting pinworm eggs either directly or indirectly These eggs are deposited around the anus by the worm and can be carried to common surfaces such as hands toys bedding clothing and toilet seats By putting anyones contaminated hands including ones own around the mouth area or putting ones mouth on common contaminated surfaces a person can ingest pinworm eggs and become infected with the pinworm parasite Since pinworm eggs are so small it is possible to ingest them while breathing
    
Once someone has ingested pinworm eggs there is an incubation period of 1 to 2 months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine Once mature the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night when many of their hosts are asleep People who are infected with pinworm can transfer the parasite to others for as long as there is a female pinworm depositing eggs on the perianal skin A person can also reinfect themselves or be reinfected by eggs from another person",Who is at risk for Parasites  Enterobiasis also known as Pinworm Infection

"Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic or long lasting disease that causes the small bile ducts in the liver to become inflamed and damaged and ultimately disappear
                
The bile ducts carry a fluid called bile from the liver to the gallbladder where it is stored When food enters the stomach after a meal the gallbladder contracts and the bile ducts carry bile to the duodenum the first part of the small intestine for use in digestion The liver makes bile which is made up of bile acids cholesterol fats and fluids Bile helps the body absorb fats cholesterol and fatsoluble vitamins Bile also carries cholesterol toxins and waste products to the intestines where the body removes them When chronic inflammation or swelling damages the bile ducts bile and toxic wastes build up in the liver damaging liver tissue
                
This damage to the liver tissue can lead to cirrhosis a condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and is unable to function normally In cirrhosis scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue partially blocking the flow of blood through the liver
                
The liver is the bodys largest internal organ The liver is called the bodys metabolic factory because of the important role it plays in metabolismthe way cells change food into energy after food is digested and absorbed into the blood The liver has many functions including
                
 taking up storing and processing nutrients from foodincluding fat sugar and proteinand delivering them to the rest of the body when needed   making new proteins such as clotting factors and immune factors   producing bile   removing waste products the kidneys cannot remove such as fats cholesterol toxins and medications
                
A healthy liver is necessary for survival The liver can regenerate most of its own cells when they become damaged However if injury to the liver is too severe or long lasting regeneration is incomplete and the liver creates scar tissue Scarring of the liver may lead to cirrhosis
                
The buildup of scar tissue that causes cirrhosis is usually a slow and gradual process In the early stages of cirrhosis the liver continues to function However as cirrhosis gets worse and scar tissue replaces more healthy tissue the liver will begin to fail Chronic liver failure which is also called endstage liver disease progresses over months years or even decades With endstage liver disease the liver can no longer perform important functions or effectively replace damaged cells
                
Primary biliary cirrhosis usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 65 and affects women more often than men1",What is are Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

"People who have Fanconi anemia FA are born with the disorder They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth For this reason FA isnt always diagnosed when a person is born In fact most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years
                
The tests used to diagnose FA depend on a persons age and symptoms In all cases medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing FA However because FA has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis
                
Specialists Involved
                
A geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes
                
Geneticists do genetic testing for FA They also can provide counseling about how FA is inherited and the types of prenatal before birth testing used to diagnose it
                
An obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to FA before your child is born An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women
                
After your child is born a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has FA A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens
                
A hematologist blood disease specialist also may help diagnose FA
                
Family and Medical Histories
                
FA is an inherited disease Some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of FA even if they dont have the disease
                
Other parents especially if theyre FA carriers may not be aware of a family history of FA Many parents may not know that FA can be passed from parents to children
                
Knowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has FA or another condition with similar symptoms
                
If your doctor thinks that you your siblings or your children have FA he or she may ask you detailed questions about
                
Any personal or family history of anemia
                
Any surgeries youve had related to the digestive system
                
Any personal or family history of immune disorders
                
Your appetite eating habits and any medicines you take
                
If you know your family has a history of FA or if your answers to your doctors questions suggest a possible diagnosis of FA your doctor will recommend further testing
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
The signs and symptoms of FA arent unique to the disease Theyre also linked to many other diseases and conditions such as aplastic anemia For this reason genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of FA Genetic tests for FA include the following
                
Chromosome Breakage Test
                
This is the most common test for FA Its available only in special laboratories labs It shows whether your chromosomes long chains of genes break more easily than normal
                
Skin cells sometimes are used for the test Usually though a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle A technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals
                
If you have FA the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals This doesnt happen in the cells of people who dont have FA
                
Cytometric Flow Analysis
                
Cytometric flow analysis or CFA is done in a lab This test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide Skin cells are used for this test
                
A technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally If you have FA your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals
                
The chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test This doesnt happen in the cells of people who dont have FA
                
Mutation Screening
                
A mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes Geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes usually using a sample of your skin cells With special equipment and lab processes they can look for gene mutations that are linked to FA
                
Diagnosing Different Age Groups
                
Before Birth Prenatal
                
If your family has a history of FA and you get pregnant your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for FA
                
Two tests can be used to diagnose FA in a developing fetus amniocentesis AMneosenTEsis and chorionic villus koreONik VILus sampling CVS Both tests are done in a doctors office or hospital
                
Amniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant womans last period A doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus A technician tests chromosomes chains of genes from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with FA
                
CVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant womans last period A doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother
                
The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with FA
                
At Birth
                
Three out of four people who inherit FA are born with birth defects If your baby is born with certain birth defects your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FA
                
For more information about these defects go to What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia
                
Childhood and Later
                
Some people who have FA are not born with birth defects Doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur This usually happens within the first 10 years of life
                
Signs of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of 3 and 12 years with 7 to 8 years as the most common ages However 10 percent of children who have FA arent diagnosed until after 16 years of age
                
If your bone marrow is failing you may have signs of aplastic anemia FA is one type of aplastic anemia
                
In aplastic anemia your bone marrow stops making or doesnt make enough of all three types of blood cells red blood cells white blood cells and platelets
                
Aplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals radiation or medicines
                
Doctors diagnose aplastic anemia using
                
Family and medical histories and a physical exam
                
A complete blood count CBC to check the number size and condition of your red blood cells The CBC also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets
                
A reticulocyte reTIKulosite count This test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate
                
Bone marrow tests For a bone marrow aspiration a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether its making enough blood cells For a bone marrow biopsy a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether its making enough blood cells
                
If you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia your doctor will want to find the cause If your doctor suspects you have FA he or she may recommend genetic testing
